             access to the application available from the user, it can make the
             experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less jarring.  Note that when
             this flag is specified the IME may <em>not</em> be set up to be able

             Note that by setting this flag, there can be cases where the action
             is simply never available to the user.  Setting this generally means
             that you think showing text being edited is more important than the

             normally are able to input ASCII even without being told so (such IMEs
             already respect this flag in a sense), but there could be some cases they
             aren't when, for instance, only non-ASCII input languagaes like Arabic,
             Greek, Hebrew, Russian are enabled in the IME.  Applications need to be
             aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it.
             However, it is strongly recommended for IME authors to respect this flag
             especially when their IME could end up with a state that has only non-ASCII
             input languages enabled.

         This flag only applies to activities that

             the system, or the user. The system automatically grants this type

             introduces potential risk, the system may not automatically
             grant it to the requesting application.  For example, any dangerous
             permissions requested by an application may be displayed to the
             user and require confirmation before proceeding, or some other
             approach may be taken to avoid the user automatically allowing

             automatically grants the permission without notifying the user or

             access to the application available from the user, it can make the
             experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less jarring.  Note that when
             this flag is specified the IME may <em>not</em> be set up to be able

             Note that by setting this flag, there can be cases where the action
             is simply never available to the user.  Setting this generally means
             that you think showing text being edited is more important than the
             action you have supplied.

             because the action has such a significant impact or is not recoverable
             enough that accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending
             a message.    Note that {@link android.widget.TextView} will

<tr><td><code>flagForceAscii</code></td><td>0x80000000</td><td> Used to request that the IME should be capable of inputting ASCII
             characters.  The intention of this flag is to ensure that the user
             can type Roman alphabet characters in a {@link android.widget.TextView}
             used for, typically, account ID or password input.  It is expected that IMEs
             normally are able to input ASCII even without being told so (such IMEs
             already respect this flag in a sense), but there could be some cases they
             aren't when, for instance, only non-ASCII input languagaes like Arabic,
             Greek, Hebrew, Russian are enabled in the IME.  Applications need to be
             aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it.
             However, it is strongly recommended for IME authors to respect this flag
             especially when their IME could end up with a state that has only non-ASCII

             specifies there is something interesting that a backward navigation
             can focus on.  If the user selects the IME's facility to backward
             navigate, this will show up in the application as an actionPrevious
             at {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputConnection#performEditorAction(int)
             InputConnection.performEditorAction(int)}.

<tr><td><code>flagNavigateNext</code></td><td>0x8000000</td><td> Used to specify that there is something
             interesting that a forward navigation can focus on. This is like using
             actionNext, except allows the IME to be multiline (with
             an enter key) as well as provide forward navigation.  Note that some
             IMEs may not be able to do this, especially when running on a small
             screen where there is little space.  In that case it does not need to
             present a UI for this option.  Like actionNext, if the
             user selects the IME's facility to forward navigate, this will show up
             in the application at
             {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputConnection#performEditorAction(int)
             InputConnection.performEditorAction(int)}.
             <p>Corresponds to
             {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#IME_FLAG_NAVIGATE_NEXT}. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>flagNoExtractUi</code></td><td>0x10000000</td><td> Used to specify that the IME does not need
             to show its extracted text UI.  For input methods that may be fullscreen,
             often when in landscape mode, this allows them to be smaller and let part
             of the application be shown behind.  Though there will likely be limited
             access to the application available from the user, it can make the
             experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less jarring.  Note that when
             this flag is specified the IME may <em>not</em> be set up to be able
             to display text, so it should only be used in situations where this is
             not needed.
             <p>Corresponds to
             {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#IME_FLAG_NO_EXTRACT_UI}. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>flagNoAccessoryAction</code></td><td>0x20000000</td><td> Used in conjunction with a custom action, this indicates that the
             action should not be available as an accessory button when the
             input method is full-screen.
             Note that by setting this flag, there can be cases where the action
             is simply never available to the user.  Setting this generally means
             that you think showing text being edited is more important than the
             action you have supplied.
             <p>Corresponds to
             {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#IME_FLAG_NO_ACCESSORY_ACTION}. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>flagNoEnterAction</code></td><td>0x40000000</td><td> Used in conjunction with a custom action,
             this indicates that the action should not be available in-line as
             a replacement for the "enter" key.  Typically this is
             because the action has such a significant impact or is not recoverable
             enough that accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending
             a message.    Note that {@link android.widget.TextView} will
             automatically set this flag for you on multi-line text views.
             <p>Corresponds to
             {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#IME_FLAG_NO_ENTER_ACTION}. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>flagForceAscii</code></td><td>0x80000000</td><td> Used to request that the IME should be capable of inputting ASCII
             characters.  The intention of this flag is to ensure that the user
             can type Roman alphabet characters in a {@link android.widget.TextView}
             used for, typically, account ID or password input.  It is expected that IMEs
             normally are able to input ASCII even without being told so (such IMEs
             already respect this flag in a sense), but there could be some cases they
             aren't when, for instance, only non-ASCII input languagaes like Arabic,
             Greek, Hebrew, Russian are enabled in the IME.  Applications need to be
             aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it.
             However, it is strongly recommended for IME authors to respect this flag
             especially when their IME could end up with a state that has only non-ASCII
             input languages enabled.

             an enter key) as well as provide forward navigation.  Note that some

             often when in landscape mode, this allows them to be smaller and let part
             of the application be shown behind.  Though there will likely be limited
             access to the application available from the user, it can make the
             experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less jarring.  Note that when
             this flag is specified the IME may <em>not</em> be set up to be able
             to display text, so it should only be used in situations where this is

             action should not be available as an accessory button when the
             input method is full-screen.
             Note that by setting this flag, there can be cases where the action
             is simply never available to the user.  Setting this generally means
             that you think showing text being edited is more important than the
             action you have supplied.

             this indicates that the action should not be available in-line as
             a replacement for the "enter" key.  Typically this is
             because the action has such a significant impact or is not recoverable
             enough that accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending
             a message.    Note that {@link android.widget.TextView} will
             automatically set this flag for you on multi-line text views.

<tr><td><code>flagForceAscii</code></td><td>0x80000000</td><td> Used to request that the IME should be capable of inputting ASCII
             characters.  The intention of this flag is to ensure that the user
             can type Roman alphabet characters in a {@link android.widget.TextView}
             used for, typically, account ID or password input.  It is expected that IMEs
             normally are able to input ASCII even without being told so (such IMEs
             already respect this flag in a sense), but there could be some cases they
             aren't when, for instance, only non-ASCII input languagaes like Arabic,
