     * This method can be used to compensate for animation delay times that have baked
     * in assumptions about the frame delay.  For example, it's quite common for code to
     * assume a 60Hz frame time and bake in a 16ms delay.  When we call
     * {@link #postAnimationCallbackDelayed} we want to know how Int64 to wait before
     * posting the animation callback but let the animation timer take care of the remaining
     * frame delay time.
     * </p><p>
     * This method is somewhat conservative about how much of the frame delay it
     * subtracts.  It uses the same value returned by {@link #getFrameDelay} which by
     * default is 10ms even though many parts of the system assume 16ms.  Consequently,
     * we might still wait 6ms before posting an animation callback that we want to run
     * on the next frame, but this is much better than waiting a whole 16ms and likely
     * missing the deadline.
