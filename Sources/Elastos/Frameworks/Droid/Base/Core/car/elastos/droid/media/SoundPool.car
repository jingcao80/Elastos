    /**
     * The SoundPool class manages and plays audio resources for applications.
     *
     * <p>A SoundPool is a collection of samples that can be loaded into memory
     * from a resource inside the APK or from a file in the file system. The
     * SoundPool library uses the MediaPlayer service to decode the audio
     * into a raw 16-bit PCM mono or stereo stream. This allows applications
     * to ship with compressed streams without having to suffer the CPU load
     * and latency of decompressing during playback.</p>
     *
     * <p>In addition to low-latency playback, SoundPool can also manage the number
     * of audio streams being rendered at once. When the SoundPool object is
     * constructed, the maxStreams parameter sets the maximum number of streams
     * that can be played at a time from this single SoundPool. SoundPool tracks
     * the number of active streams. If the maximum number of streams is exceeded,
     * SoundPool will automatically stop a previously playing stream based first
     * on priority and then by age within that priority. Limiting the maximum
     * number of streams helps to cap CPU loading and reducing the likelihood that
     * audio mixing will impact visuals or UI performance.</p>
     *
     * <p>Sounds can be looped by setting a non-zero loop value. A value of -1
     * causes the sound to loop forever. In this case, the application must
     * explicitly call the stop() function to stop the sound. Any other non-zero
     * value will cause the sound to repeat the specified number of times, e.g.
     * a value of 3 causes the sound to play a total of 4 times.</p>
     *
     * <p>The playback rate can also be changed. A playback rate of 1.0 causes
     * the sound to play at its original frequency (resampled, if necessary,
     * to the hardware output frequency). A playback rate of 2.0 causes the
     * sound to play at twice its original frequency, and a playback rate of
     * 0.5 causes it to play at half its original frequency. The playback
     * rate range is 0.5 to 2.0.</p>
     *
     * <p>Priority runs low to high, i.e. higher numbers are higher priority.
     * Priority is used when a call to play() would cause the number of active
     * streams to exceed the value established by the maxStreams parameter when
     * the SoundPool was created. In this case, the stream allocator will stop
     * the lowest priority stream. If there are multiple streams with the same
     * low priority, it will choose the oldest stream to stop. In the case
     * where the priority of the new stream is lower than all the active
     * streams, the new sound will not play and the play() function will return
     * a streamID of zero.</p>
     *
     * <p>Let's examine a typical use case: A game consists of several levels of
     * play. For each level, there is a set of unique sounds that are used only
     * by that level. In this case, the game logic should create a new SoundPool
     * object when the first level is loaded. The level data itself might contain
     * the list of sounds to be used by this level. The loading logic iterates
     * through the list of sounds calling the appropriate SoundPool.load()
     * function. This should typically be done early in the process to allow time
     * for decompressing the audio to raw PCM format before they are needed for
     * playback.</p>
     *
     * <p>Once the sounds are loaded and play has started, the application can
     * trigger sounds by calling SoundPool.play(). Playing streams can be
     * paused or resumed, and the application can also alter the pitch by
     * adjusting the playback rate in real-time for doppler or synthesis
     * effects.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that since streams can be stopped due to resource constraints, the
     * streamID is a reference to a particular instance of a stream. If the stream
     * is stopped to allow a higher priority stream to play, the stream is no
     * longer be valid. However, the application is allowed to call methods on
     * the streamID without error. This may help simplify program logic since
     * the application need not concern itself with the stream lifecycle.</p>
     *
     * <p>In our example, when the player has completed the level, the game
     * logic should call SoundPool.release() to release all the native resources
     * in use and then set the SoundPool reference to null. If the player starts
     * another level, a new SoundPool is created, sounds are loaded, and play
     * resumes.</p>
