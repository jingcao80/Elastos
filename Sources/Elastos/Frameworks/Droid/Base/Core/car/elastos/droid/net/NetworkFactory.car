     * A NetworkFactory is an entity that creates NetworkAgent objects.

     * their factory will start receiving scored NetworkRequests.  NetworkRequests
     * can be filtered 3 ways: by NetworkCapabilities, by score and more complexly by
     * overridden function.  All of these can be dynamic - changing NetworkCapabilities
     * or score forces re-evaluation of all current requests.
     *
     * If any requests pass the filter some overrideable functions will be called.
     * If the bearer only cares about very simple start/stopNetwork callbacks, those
     * functions can be overridden.  If the bearer needs more interaction, it can
     * override addNetworkRequest and removeNetworkRequest which will give it each
     * request that passes their current filters.
