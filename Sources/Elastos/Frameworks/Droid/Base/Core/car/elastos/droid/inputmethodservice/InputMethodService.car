    /**
     * InputMethodService provides a standard implementation of an InputMethod,
     * which final implementations can derive from and customize.  See the
     * base class {@link AbstractInputMethodService} and the {@link InputMethod}
     * interface for more information on the basics of writing input methods.
     *
     * <p>In addition to the normal Service lifecycle methods, this class
     * introduces some new specific callbacks that most subclasses will want
     * to make use of:</p>
     * <ul>
     * <li> {@link #onInitializeInterface()} for user-interface initialization,
     * in particular to deal with configuration changes while the service is
     * running.
     * <li> {@link #onBindInput} to find out about switching to a new client.
     * <li> {@link #onStartInput} to deal with an input session starting with
     * the client.
     * <li> {@link #onCreateInputView()}, {@link #onCreateCandidatesView()},
     * and {@link #onCreateExtractTextView()} for non-demand generation of the UI.
     * <li> {@link #onStartInputView(EditorInfo, boolean)} to deal with input
     * starting within the input area of the IME.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>An input method has significant discretion in how it goes about its
     * work: the {@link android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService} provides
     * a basic framework for standard UI elements (input view, candidates view,
     * and running in fullscreen mode), but it is up to a particular implementor
     * to decide how to use them.  For example, one input method could implement
     * an input area with a keyboard, another could allow the user to draw text,
     * while a third could have no input area (and thus not be visible to the
     * user) but instead listen to audio and perform text to speech conversion.</p>
     *
     * <p>In the implementation provided here, all of these elements are placed
     * together in a single window managed by the InputMethodService.  It will
     * execute callbacks as it needs information about them, and provides APIs for
     * programmatic control over them.  They layout of these elements is explicitly
     * defined:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>The soft input view, if available, is placed at the bottom of the
     * screen.
     * <li>The candidates view, if currently shown, is placed above the soft
     * input view.
     * <li>If not running fullscreen, the application is moved or resized to be
     * above these views; if running fullscreen, the window will completely cover
     * the application and its top part will contain the extract text of what is
     * currently being edited by the application.
     * </ul>
     *
     *
     * <a name="SoftInputView"></a>
     * <h3>Soft Input View</h3>
     *
     * <p>Central to most input methods is the soft input view.  This is where most
     * user interaction occurs: pressing on soft keys, drawing characters, or
     * however else your input method wants to generate text.  Most implementations
     * will simply have their own view doing all of this work, and return a new
     * instance of it when {@link #onCreateInputView()} is called.  At that point,
     * as long as the input view is visible, you will see user interaction in
     * that view and can call back on the InputMethodService to interact with the
     * application as appropriate.</p>
     *
     * <p>There are some situations where you want to decide whether or not your
     * soft input view should be shown to the user.  This is done by implementing
     * the {@link #onEvaluateInputViewShown()} to return true or false based on
     * whether it should be shown in the current environment.  If any of your
     * state has changed that may impact this, call
     * {@link #updateInputViewShown()} to have it re-evaluated.  The default
     * implementation always shows the input view unless there is a hard
     * keyboard available, which is the appropriate behavior for most input
     * methods.</p>
     *
     *
     * <a name="CandidatesView"></a>
     * <h3>Candidates View</h3>
     *
     * <p>Often while the user is generating raw text, an input method wants to
     * provide them with a list of possible interpretations of that text that can
     * be selected for use.  This is accomplished with the candidates view, and
     * like the soft input view you implement {@link #onCreateCandidatesView()}
     * to instantiate your own view implementing your candidates UI.</p>
     *
     * <p>Management of the candidates view is a little different than the input
     * view, because the candidates view tends to be more transient, being shown
     * only when there are possible candidates for the current text being entered
     * by the user.  To control whether the candidates view is shown, you use
     * {@link #setCandidatesViewShown(boolean)}.  Note that because the candidate
     * view tends to be shown and hidden a lot, it does not impact the application
     * UI in the same way as the soft input view: it will never cause application
     * windows to resize, only cause them to be panned if needed for the user to
     * see the current focus.</p>
     *
     *
     * <a name="FullscreenMode"></a>
     * <h3>Fullscreen Mode</h3>
     *
     * <p>Sometimes your input method UI is too large to integrate with the
     * application UI, so you just want to take over the screen.  This is
     * accomplished by switching to full-screen mode, causing the input method
     * window to fill the entire screen and add its own "extracted text" editor
     * showing the user the text that is being typed.  Unlike the other UI elements,
     * there is a standard implementation for the extract editor that you should
     * not need to change.  The editor is placed at the top of the IME, above the
     * input and candidates views.</p>
     *
     * <p>Similar to the input view, you control whether the IME is running in
     * fullscreen mode by implementing {@link #onEvaluateFullscreenMode()}
     * to return true or false based on
     * whether it should be fullscreen in the current environment.  If any of your
     * state has changed that may impact this, call
     * {@link #updateFullscreenMode()} to have it re-evaluated.  The default
     * implementation selects fullscreen mode when the screen is in a landscape
     * orientation, which is appropriate behavior for most input methods that have
     * a significant input area.</p>
     *
     * <p>When in fullscreen mode, you have some special requirements because the
     * user can not see the application UI.  In particular, you should implement
     * {@link #onDisplayCompletions(CompletionInfo[])} to show completions
     * generated by your application, typically in your candidates view like you
     * would normally show candidates.
     *
     *
     * <a name="GeneratingText"></a>
     * <h3>Generating Text</h3>
     *
     * <p>The key part of an IME is of course generating text for the application.
     * This is done through calls to the
     * {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputConnection} interface to the
     * application, which can be retrieved from {@link #getCurrentInputConnection()}.
     * This interface allows you to generate raw key events or, if the target
     * supports it, directly edit in strings of candidates and committed text.</p>
     *
     * <p>Information about what the target is expected and supports can be found
     * through the {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo} class, which is
     * retrieved with {@link #getCurrentInputEditorInfo()} method.  The most
     * important part of this is {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#inputType
     * EditorInfo.inputType}; in particular, if this is
     * {@link android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo#TYPE_NULL EditorInfo.TYPE_NULL},
     * then the target does not support complex edits and you need to only deliver
     * raw key events to it.  An input method will also want to look at other
     * values here, to for example detect password mode, auto complete text views,
     * phone number entry, etc.</p>
     *
     * <p>When the user switches between input targets, you will receive calls to
     * {@link #onFinishInput()} and {@link #onStartInput(EditorInfo, boolean)}.
     * You can use these to reset and initialize your input state for the current
     * target.  For example, you will often want to clear any input state, and
     * update a soft keyboard to be appropriate for the new inputType.</p>
