    /**
     * An accessibility service runs in the background and receives callbacks by the system
     * when {@link AccessibilityEvent}s are fired. Such events denote some state transition
     * in the user interface, for example, the focus has changed, a button has been clicked,
     * etc. Such a service can optionally request the capability for querying the content
     * of the active window. Development of an accessibility service requires extending this
     * class and implementing its abstract methods.
     *
     * <div class="special reference">
     * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
     * <p>For more information about creating AccessibilityServices, read the
     * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/ui/accessibility/index.html">Accessibility</a>
     * developer guide.</p>
     * </div>
     *
     * <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
     * <p>
     * The lifecycle of an accessibility service is managed exclusively by the system and
     * follows the established service life cycle. Additionally, starting or stopping an
     * accessibility service is triggered exclusively by an explicit user action through
     * enabling or disabling it in the device settings. After the system binds to a service it
     * calls {@link AccessibilityService#onServiceConnected()}. This method can be
     * overriden by clients that want to perform post binding setup.
     * </p>
     * <h3>Declaration</h3>
     * <p>
     * An accessibility is declared as any other service in an AndroidManifest.xml but it
     * must also specify that it handles the "android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService"
     * {@link android.content.Intent}. Failure to declare this intent will cause the system to
     * ignore the accessibility service. Additionally an accessibility service must request the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE} permission to ensure
     * that only the system
     * can bind to it. Failure to declare this intent will cause the system to ignore the
     * accessibility service. Following is an example declaration:
     * </p>
     * <pre> &lt;service android:name=".MyAccessibilityService"
     *         android:permission="android.permission.BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE"&gt;
     *     &lt;intent-filter&gt;
     *         &lt;action android:name="android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService" /&gt;
     *     &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
     *     . . .
     * &lt;/service&gt;</pre>
     * <h3>Configuration</h3>
     * <p>
     * An accessibility service can be configured to receive specific types of accessibility events,
     * listen only to specific packages, get events from each type only once in a given time frame,
     * retrieve window content, specify a settings activity, etc.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * There are two approaches for configuring an accessibility service:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * Providing a {@link #SERVICE_META_DATA meta-data} entry in the manifest when declaring
     * the service. A service declaration with a meta-data tag is presented below:
     * <pre> &lt;service android:name=".MyAccessibilityService"&gt;
     *     &lt;intent-filter&gt;
     *         &lt;action android:name="android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService" /&gt;
     *     &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
     *     &lt;meta-data android:name="android.accessibilityservice" android:resource="@xml/accessibilityservice" /&gt;
     * &lt;/service&gt;</pre>
     * <p class="note">
     * <strong>Note:</strong> This approach enables setting all properties.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For more details refer to {@link #SERVICE_META_DATA} and
     * <code>&lt;{@link android.R.styleable#AccessibilityService accessibility-service}&gt;</code>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * Calling {@link AccessibilityService#setServiceInfo(AccessibilityServiceInfo)}. Note
     * that this method can be called any time to dynamically change the service configuration.
     * <p class="note">
     * <strong>Note:</strong> This approach enables setting only dynamically configurable properties:
     * {@link AccessibilityServiceInfo#eventTypes},
     * {@link AccessibilityServiceInfo#feedbackType},
     * {@link AccessibilityServiceInfo#flags},
     * {@link AccessibilityServiceInfo#notificationTimeout},
     * {@link AccessibilityServiceInfo#packageNames}
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For more details refer to {@link AccessibilityServiceInfo}.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <h3>Retrieving window content</h3>
     * <p>
     * A service can specify in its declaration that it can retrieve the active window
     * content which is represented as a tree of {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo}. Note that
     * declaring this capability requires that the service declares its configuration via
     * an XML resource referenced by {@link #SERVICE_META_DATA}.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For security purposes an accessibility service can retrieve only the content of the
     * currently active window. The currently active window is defined as the window from
     * which was fired the last event of the following types:
     * {@link AccessibilityEvent#TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED},
     * {@link AccessibilityEvent#TYPE_VIEW_HOVER_ENTER},
     * {@link AccessibilityEvent#TYPE_VIEW_HOVER_EXIT},
     * In other words, the last window that was shown or the last window that the user has touched
     * during touch exploration.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The entry point for retrieving window content is through calling
     * {@link AccessibilityEvent#getSource() AccessibilityEvent.getSource()} of the last received
     * event of the above types or a previous event from the same window
     * (see {@link AccessibilityEvent#getWindowId() AccessibilityEvent.getWindowId()}). Invoking
     * this method will return an {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo} that can be used to traverse the
     * window content which represented as a tree of such objects.
     * </p>
     * <p class="note">
     * <strong>Note</strong> An accessibility service may have requested to be notified for
     * a subset of the event types, thus be unaware that the active window has changed. Therefore
     * accessibility service that would like to retrieve window content should:
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * Register for all event types with no notification timeout and keep track for the active
     * window by calling {@link AccessibilityEvent#getWindowId()} of the last received event and
     * compare this with the {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo#getWindowId()} before calling retrieval
     * methods on the latter.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * Prepare that a retrieval method on {@link AccessibilityNodeInfo} may fail since the
     * active window has changed and the service did not get the accessibility event yet. Note
     * that it is possible to have a retrieval method failing even adopting the strategy
     * specified in the previous bullet because the accessibility event dispatch is asynchronous
     * and crosses process boundaries.
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     * <h3>Notification strategy</h3>
     * <p>
     * For each feedback type only one accessibility service is notified. Services are notified
     * in the order of registration. Hence, if two services are registered for the same
     * feedback type in the same package the first one wins. It is possible however, to
     * register a service as the default one for a given feedback type. In such a case this
     * service is invoked if no other service was interested in the event. In other words, default
     * services do not compete with other services and are notified last regardless of the
     * registration order. This enables "generic" accessibility services that work reasonably
     * well with most applications to coexist with "polished" ones that are targeted for
     * specific applications.
     * </p>
     * <p class="note">
     * <strong>Note:</strong> The event notification timeout is useful to avoid propagating
     * events to the client too frequently since this is accomplished via an expensive
     * interprocess call. One can think of the timeout as a criteria to determine when
     * event generation has settled down.</p>
