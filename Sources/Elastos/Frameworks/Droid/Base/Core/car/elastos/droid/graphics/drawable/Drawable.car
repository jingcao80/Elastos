    /**
     * A Drawable is a general abstraction for "something that can be drawn."  Most
     * often you will deal with Drawable as the type of resource retrieved for
     * drawing things to the screen; the Drawable class provides a generic API for
     * dealing with an underlying visual resource that may take a variety of forms.
     * Unlike a
     *
     * @sa android.view.View
     *, a Drawable does not have any facility to
     * receive events or otherwise interact with the user.
     *
     * <p>In addition to simple drawing, Drawable provides a number of generic
     * mechanisms for its client to interact with what is being drawn:
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li> The
     *
     *     @sa #setBounds
     *     method <var>must</var> be called to tell the
     *     Drawable where it is drawn and how large it should be.  All Drawables
     *     should respect the requested size, often simply by scaling their
     *     imagery.  A client can find the preferred size for some Drawables with
     *     the
     *
     *     @sa #getIntrinsicHeight
     *     and
     *
     *     @sa #getIntrinsicWidth
     *     methods.
     *
     *     <li> The
     *
     *     @sa #getPadding
     *     method can return from some Drawables
     *     information about how to frame content that is placed inside of them.
     *     For example, a Drawable that is intended to be the frame for a button
     *     widget would need to return padding that correctly places the label
     *     inside of itself.
     *
     *     <li> The
     *
     *     @sa #setState
     *     method allows the client to tell the Drawable
     *     in which state it is to be drawn, such as "focused", "selected", etc.
     *     Some drawables may modify their imagery based on the selected state.
     *
     *     <li> The
     *
     *     @sa #setLevel
     *     method allows the client to supply a single
     *     continuous controller that can modify the Drawable is displayed, such as
     *     a battery level or progress level.  Some drawables may modify their
     *     imagery based on the current level.
     *
     *     <li> A Drawable can perform animations by calling back to its client
     *     through the
     *
     *     @sa Callback
     *     interface.  All clients should support this
     *     interface (via
     *
     *     @sa #setCallback
     *     ) so that animations will work.  A
     *     simple way to do this is through the system facilities such as
     *
     *     @sa android.view.View#setBackgroundDrawable(Drawable)
     *     and
     *
     *     @sa android.widget.ImageView
     *     .
     * </ul>
     *
     * Though usually not visible to the application, Drawables may take a variety
     * of forms:
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li> <b>Bitmap</b>: the simplest Drawable, a PNG or JPEG image.
     *     <li> <b>Nine Patch</b>: an extension to the PNG format allows it to
     *     specify information about how to stretch it and place things inside of
     *     it.
     *     <li> <b>Shape</b>: contains simple drawing commands instead of a raw
     *     bitmap, allowing it to resize better in some cases.
     *     <li> <b>Layers</b>: a compound drawable, which draws multiple underlying
     *     drawables on top of each other.
     *     <li> <b>States</b>: a compound drawable that selects one of a set of
     *     drawables based on its state.
     *     <li> <b>Levels</b>: a compound drawable that selects one of a set of
     *     drawables based on its level.
     *     <li> <b>Scale</b>: a compound drawable with a single child drawable,
     *     whose overall size is modified based on the current level.
     * </ul>
     *
