    /**
     * AutoScrollHelper is a utility class for adding automatic edge-triggered
     * scrolling to Views.
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> Implementing classes are responsible for overriding the
     * {@link #scrollTargetBy}, {@link #canTargetScrollHorizontally}, and
     * {@link #canTargetScrollVertically} methods. See
     * {@link AbsListViewAutoScroller} for an {@link android.widget.AbsListView}
     * -specific implementation.
     * <p>
     * <h1>Activation</h1> Automatic scrolling starts when the user touches within
     * an activation area. By default, activation areas are defined as the top,
     * left, right, and bottom 20% of the host view's total area. Touching within
     * the top activation area scrolls up, left scrolls to the left, and so on.
     * <p>
     * As the user touches closer to the extreme edge of the activation area,
     * scrolling accelerates up to a maximum velocity. When using the default edge
     * type, {@link #EDGE_TYPE_INSIDE_EXTEND}, moving outside of the view bounds
     * will scroll at the maximum velocity.
     * <p>
     * The following activation properties may be configured:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Delay after entering activation area before auto-scrolling begins, see
     * {@link #setActivationDelay}. Default value is
     * {@link ViewConfiguration#getTapTimeout()} to avoid conflicting with taps.
     * <li>Location of activation areas, see {@link #setEdgeType}. Default value is
     * {@link #EDGE_TYPE_INSIDE_EXTEND}.
     * <li>Size of activation areas relative to view size, see
     * {@link #setRelativeEdges}. Default value is 20% for both vertical and
     * horizontal edges.
     * <li>Maximum size used to constrain relative size, see
     * {@link #setMaximumEdges}. Default value is {@link #NO_MAX}.
     * </ul>
     * <h1>Scrolling</h1> When automatic scrolling is active, the helper will
     * repeatedly call {@link #scrollTargetBy} to apply new scrolling offsets.
     * <p>
     * The following scrolling properties may be configured:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Acceleration ramp-up duration, see {@link #setRampUpDuration}. Default
     * value is 500 milliseconds.
     * <li>Acceleration ramp-down duration, see {@link #setRampDownDuration}.
     * Default value is 500 milliseconds.
     * <li>Target velocity relative to view size, see {@link #setRelativeVelocity}.
     * Default value is 100% per second for both vertical and horizontal.
     * <li>Minimum velocity used to constrain relative velocity, see
     * {@link #setMinimumVelocity}. When set, scrolling will accelerate to the
     * larger of either this value or the relative target value. Default value is
     * approximately 5 centimeters or 315 dips per second.
     * <li>Maximum velocity used to constrain relative velocity, see
     * {@link #setMaximumVelocity}. Default value is approximately 25 centimeters or
     * 1575 dips per second.
     * </ul>
