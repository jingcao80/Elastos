     * to retrieve the interface, if the activity is currently involved in a voice interaction.
     *
     * <p>The voice interactor revolves around submitting voice interaction requests to the
     * back-end voice interaction service that is working with the user.  These requests are
     * submitted with {@link #submitRequest}, providing a new instance of a
     * {@link Request} subclass describing the type of operation to perform -- currently the
     * possible requests are {@link ConfirmationRequest} and {@link CommandRequest}.
     *
     * <p>Once a request is submitted, the voice system will process it and eventually deliver
     * the result to the request object.  The application can cancel a pending request at any
     * time.
     *
     * <p>The VoiceInteractor is integrated with Activity's state saving mechanism, so that
     * if an activity is being restarted with retained state, it will retain the current
     * VoiceInteractor and any outstanding requests.  Because of this, you should always use
     * {@link Request#getActivity() Request.getActivity} to get back to the activity of a
     * request, rather than holding on to the activity instance yourself, either explicitly
     * or implicitly through a non-static inner class.
