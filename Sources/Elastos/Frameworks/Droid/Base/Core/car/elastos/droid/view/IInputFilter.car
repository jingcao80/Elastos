     * Filters input events before they are dispatched to the system.
     * <p>
     * At most one input filter can be installed by calling
     * {@link WindowManagerService#setInputFilter}.  When an input filter is installed, the
     * system's behavior changes as follows:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Input events are first delivered to the {@link WindowManagerPolicy}
     * interception methods before queuing as usual.  This critical step takes care of managing
     * the power state of the device and handling wake keys.</li>
     * <li>Input events are then asynchronously delivered to the input filter's
     * {@link #onInputEvent(InputEvent)} method instead of being enqueued for dispatch to
     * applications as usual.  The input filter only receives input events that were
     * generated by input device; the input filter will not receive input events that were
     * injected into the system by other means, such as by instrumentation.</li>
     * <li>The input filter processes and optionally transforms the stream of events.  For example,
     * it may transform a sequence of motion events representing an accessibility gesture into
     * a different sequence of motion events, key presses or other system-level interactions.
     * The input filter can send events to be dispatched by calling
     * {@link #sendInputEvent(InputEvent)} and passing appropriate policy flags for the
     * input event.</li>
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     * <h3>The importance of input event consistency</h3>
     * <p>
     * The input filter mechanism is very low-level.  At a minimum, it needs to ensure that it
     * sends an internally consistent stream of input events to the dispatcher.  There are
     * very important invariants to be maintained.
     * </p><p>
     * For example, if a key down is sent, a corresponding key up should also be sent eventually.
     * Likewise, for touch events, each pointer must individually go down with
     * {@link MotionEvent#ACTION_DOWN} or {@link MotionEvent#ACTION_POINTER_DOWN} and then
     * individually go up with {@link MotionEvent#ACTION_POINTER_UP} or {@link MotionEvent#ACTION_UP}
     * and the sequence of pointer ids used must be consistent throughout the gesture.
     * </p><p>
     * Sometimes a filter may wish to cancel a previously dispatched key or motion.  It should
     * use {@link KeyEvent#FLAG_CANCELED} or {@link MotionEvent#ACTION_CANCEL} accordingly.
     * </p><p>
     * The input filter must take into account the fact that the input events coming from different
     * devices or even different sources all consist of distinct streams of input.
     * Use {@link InputEvent#getDeviceId()} and {@link InputEvent#getSource()} to identify
     * the source of the event and its semantics.  There are be multiple sources of keys,
     * touches and other input: they must be kept separate.
     * </p>
     * <h3>Policy flags</h3>
     * <p>
     * Input events received from the dispatcher and sent to the dispatcher have policy flags
     * associated with them.  Policy flags control some functions of the dispatcher.
     * </p><p>
     * The early policy interception decides whether an input event should be delivered
     * to applications or dropped.  The policy indicates its decision by setting the
     * {@link WindowManagerPolicy#FLAG_PASS_TO_USER} policy flag.  The input filter may
     * sometimes receive events that do not have this flag set.  It should take note of
     * the fact that the policy intends to drop the event, clean up its state, and
     * then send appropriate cancellation events to the dispatcher if needed.
     * </p><p>
     * For example, suppose the input filter is processing a gesture and one of the touch events
     * it receives does not have the {@link WindowManagerPolicy#FLAG_PASS_TO_USER} flag set.
     * The input filter should clear its internal state about the gesture and then send key or
     * motion events to the dispatcher to cancel any keys or pointers that are down.
     * </p><p>
     * Corollary: Events that set sent to the dispatcher should usually include the
     * {@link WindowManagerPolicy#FLAG_PASS_TO_USER} flag.  Otherwise, they will be dropped!
     * </p><p>
     * It may be prudent to disable automatic key repeating for synthetic key events
     * by setting the {@link WindowManagerPolicy#FLAG_DISABLE_KEY_REPEAT} policy flag.
     * </p>
