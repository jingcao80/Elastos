     * SSLSocketFactory implementation with several extra features:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>Timeout specification for SSL handshake operations
     * <li>Hostname verification in most cases (see WARNINGs below)
     * <li>Optional SSL session caching with {@link SSLSessionCache}
     * <li>Optionally bypass all SSL certificate checks
     * </ul>
     *
     * The handshake timeout does not apply to actual TCP socket connection.
     * If you want a connection timeout as well, use {@link #createSocket()}
     * and {@link Socket#connect(SocketAddress, int)}, after which you
     * must verify the identity of the server you are connected to.
     *
     * <p class="caution"><b>Most {@link SSLSocketFactory} implementations do not
     * verify the server's identity, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.</b>
     * This implementation does check the server's certificate hostname, but only
     * for createSocket variants that specify a hostname.  When using methods that
     * use {@link InetAddress} or which return an unconnected socket, you MUST
     * verify the server's identity yourself to ensure a secure connection.</p>
     *
     * <p>One way to verify the server's identity is to use
     * {@link HttpsURLConnection#getDefaultHostnameVerifier()} to get a
     * {@link HostnameVerifier} to verify the certificate hostname.
     *
     * <p>On development devices, "setprop socket.relaxsslcheck yes" bypasses all
     * SSL certificate and hostname checks for testing purposes.  This setting
     * requires root access.
