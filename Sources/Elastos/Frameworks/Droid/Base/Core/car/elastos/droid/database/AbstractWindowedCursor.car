     * The cursor owns the cursor window it uses.  When the cursor is closed,
     * its window is also closed.  Likewise, when the window used by the cursor is
     * changed, its old window is closed.  This policy of strict ownership ensures
     * that cursor windows are not leaked.
     * </p><p>
     * Subclasses are responsible for filling the cursor window with data during
     * {@link #onMove(int, int)}, allocating a new cursor window if necessary.
     * During {@link #requery()}, the existing cursor window should be cleared and
     * filled with new data.
     * </p><p>
     * If the contents of the cursor change or become invalid, the old window must be closed
     * (because it is owned by the cursor) and set to null.
