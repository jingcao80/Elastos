        /**
        * A Drawable is a general abstraction for "something that can be drawn." Most often
        * you will deal with Drawable as the type of resource retrieved for drawing things
        * to the screen; the Drawable class provides a generic API for dealing with an
        * underlying visual resource that may take a variety of forms. Unlike a View, a
        * Drawable does not have any facility to receive events or otherwise interact with
        * the user.
        *
        * @sa  View
        * <p>
        * In addition to simple drawing, Drawable provides a number of generic mechanisms
        * for its client to interact with what is being drawn:
        * <p>
        * The setBounds(Rect) method must be called to tell the Drawable where it is drawn
        * and how large it should be. All Drawables should respect the requested size,
        * often simply by scaling their imagery. A client can find the preferred size for
        * some Drawables with the getIntrinsicHeight() and getIntrinsicWidth() methods.
        *
        * @sa setBounds(Rect)
        * @sa getIntrinsicHeight()
        * @sa getIntrinsicWidth()
        * <p>
        * The getPadding(Rect) method can return from some Drawables information about how
        * to frame content that is placed inside of them. For example, a Drawable that is
        * intended to be the frame for a button widget would need to return padding that
        * correctly places the label inside of itself.
        *
        * @sa getPadding(Rect)
        * <p>
        * The setState(int[]) method allows the client to tell the Drawable in which state
        * it is to be drawn, such as "focused", "selected", etc. Some drawables may modify
        * their imagery based on the selected state.
        *
        * @sa setState(int[])
        * <p>
        * The setLevel(int) method allows the client to supply a single continuous
        * controller that can modify the Drawable is displayed, such as a battery level or
        * progress level. Some drawables may modify their imagery based on the current
        * level.
        *
        * @sa setLevel(int)
        * <p>
        * A Drawable can perform animations by calling back to its client through the
        * Drawable.Callback interface. All clients should support this interface
        * (via setCallback(Drawable.Callback)) so that animations will work. A simple way
        * to do this is through the system facilities such as
        * (setBackgroundDrawable(Drawable) and ImageView.
        *
        * @sa Drawable.Callback
        * @sa setCallback(Drawable.Callback
        * @sa setBackgroundDrawable(Drawable)
        * @sa ImageView
        * <p>
        * Though usually not visible to the application, Drawables may take a variety of
        * forms:
        * Bitmap: the simplest Drawable, a PNG or JPEG image.
        * Nine Patch: an extension to the PNG format allows it to specify information about
        * how to stretch it and place things inside of it.
        * Shape: contains simple drawing commands instead of a raw bitmap, allowing it to
        * resize better in some cases.
        * Layers: a compound drawable, which draws multiple underlying drawables on top of
        * each other.
        * States: a compound drawable that selects one of a set of drawables based on its
        * state.
        * Levels: a compound drawable that selects one of a set of drawables based on its
        * level.
        * Scale: a compound drawable with a single child drawable, whose overall size is
        * modified based on the current level.
        *
