     * if it exists, creating it if it does not, and upgrading it as necessary.
     * Transactions are used to make sure the database is always in a sensible state.
     *
     * <p>This class makes it easy for {@link android.content.ContentProvider}
     * implementations to defer opening and upgrading the database until first use,
     * to avoid blocking application startup with long-running database upgrades.
     *
     * <p>For an example, see the NotePadProvider class in the NotePad sample application,
     * in the <em>samples/</em> directory of the SDK.</p>

     * monotonically increasing version numbers for upgrades.</p>
