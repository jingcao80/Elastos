     * <h3>Architecture Overview</h3>
     *
     * <p>There are three primary parties involved in the input method
     * framework (IMF) architecture:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li> The <strong>input method manager</strong> as expressed by this class
     * is the central point of the system that manages interaction between all
     * other parts.  It is expressed as the client-side API here which exists
     * in each application context and communicates with a global system service
     * that manages the interaction across all processes.
     * <li> An <strong>input method (IME)</strong> implements a particular
     * interaction model allowing the user to generate text.  The system binds
     * to the current input method that is use, causing it to be created and run,
     * and tells it when to hide and show its UI.  Only one IME is running at a time.
     * <li> Multiple <strong>client applications</strong> arbitrate with the input
     * method manager for input focus and control over the state of the IME.  Only
     * one such client is ever active (working with the IME) at a time.
     * </ul>
     *
     *
     * <a name="Applications"></a>
     * <h3>Applications</h3>
     *
     * <p>In most cases, applications that are using the standard
     * {@link android.widget.TextView} or its subclasses will have little they need
     * to do to work well with soft input methods.  The main things you need to
     * be aware of are:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li> Properly set the {@link android.R.attr#inputType} in your editable
     * text views, so that the input method will have enough context to help the
     * user in entering text into them.
     * <li> Deal well with losing screen space when the input method is
     * displayed.  Ideally an application should handle its window being resized
     * smaller, but it can rely on the system performing panning of the window
     * if needed.  You should set the {@link android.R.attr#windowSoftInputMode}
     * attribute on your activity or the corresponding values on windows you
     * create to help the system determine whether to pan or resize (it will
     * try to determine this automatically but may get it wrong).
     * <li> You can also control the preferred soft input state (open, closed, etc)
     * for your window using the same {@link android.R.attr#windowSoftInputMode}
     * attribute.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>More finer-grained control is available through the APIs here to directly
     * interact with the IMF and its IME -- either showing or hiding the input
     * area, letting the user pick an input method, etc.</p>
     *
     * <p>For the rare people amongst us writing their own text editors, you
     * will need to implement {@link android.view.View#onCreateInputConnection}
     * to return a new instance of your own {@link InputConnection} interface
     * allowing the IME to interact with your editor.</p>
     *
     *
     * <a name="InputMethods"></a>
     * <h3>Input Methods</h3>
     *
     * <p>An input method (IME) is implemented
     * as a {@link android.app.Service}, typically deriving from
     * {@link android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService}.  It must provide
     * the core {@link InputMethod} interface, though this is normally handled by
     * {@link android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService} and implementors will
     * only need to deal with the higher-level API there.</p>
     *
     * See the {@link android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService} class for
     * more information on implementing IMEs.
     *
     *
     * <a name="Security"></a>
     * <h3>Security</h3>
     *
     * <p>There are a lot of security issues associated with input methods,
     * since they essentially have freedom to completely drive the UI and monitor
     * everything the user enters.  The Android input method framework also allows
     * arbitrary third party IMEs, so care must be taken to restrict their
     * selection and interactions.</p>
     *
     * <p>Here are some key points about the security architecture behind the
     * IMF:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li> <p>Only the system is allowed to directly access an IME's
     * {@link InputMethod} interface, via the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_INPUT_METHOD} permission.  This is
     * enforced in the system by not binding to an input method service that does
     * not require this permission, so the system can guarantee no other untrusted
     * clients are accessing the current input method outside of its control.</p>
     *
     * <li> <p>There may be many client processes of the IMF, but only one may
     * be active at a time.  The inactive clients can not interact with key
     * parts of the IMF through the mechanisms described below.</p>
     *
     * <li> <p>Clients of an input method are only given access to its
     * {@link InputMethodSession} interface.  One instance of this interface is
     * created for each client, and only calls from the session associated with
     * the active client will be processed by the current IME.  This is enforced
     * by {@link android.inputmethodservice.AbstractInputMethodService} for normal
     * IMEs, but must be explicitly handled by an IME that is customizing the
     * raw {@link InputMethodSession} implementation.</p>
     *
     * <li> <p>Only the active client's {@link InputConnection} will accept
     * operations.  The IMF tells each client process whether it is active, and
     * the framework enforces that in inactive processes calls on to the current
     * InputConnection will be ignored.  This ensures that the current IME can
     * only deliver events and text edits to the UI that the user sees as
     * being in focus.</p>
     *
     * <li> <p>An IME can never interact with an {@link InputConnection} while
     * the screen is off.  This is enforced by making all clients inactive while
     * the screen is off, and prevents bad IMEs from driving the UI when the user
     * can not be aware of its behavior.</p>
     *
     * <li> <p>A client application can ask that the system let the user pick a
     * new IME, but can not programmatically switch to one itself.  This avoids
     * malicious applications from switching the user to their own IME, which
     * remains running when the user navigates away to another application.  An
     * IME, on the other hand, <em>is</em> allowed to programmatically switch
     * the system to another IME, since it already has full control of user
     * input.</p>
     *
     * <li> <p>The user must explicitly enable a new IME in settings before
     * they can switch to it, to confirm with the system that they know about it
     * and want to make it available for use.</p>
     * </ul>
