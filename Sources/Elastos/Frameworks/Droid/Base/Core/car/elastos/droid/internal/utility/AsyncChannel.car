    /**
     * <p>An asynchronous channel between two handlers.</p>
     *
     * <p>The handlers maybe in the same process or in another process. There
     * are two protocol styles that can be used with an AysncChannel. The
     * first is a simple request/reply protocol where the server does
     * not need to know which client is issuing the request.</p>
     *
     * <p>In a simple request/reply protocol the client/source sends requests to the
     * server/destination. And the server uses the replyToMessage methods.
     * In this usage model there is no need for the destination to
     * use the connect methods. The typical sequence of operations is:</p>
     *<ol>
     *   <li>Client calls AsyncChannel#connectSync or Asynchronously:</li>
     *      <ol>For an asynchronous half connection client calls AsyncChannel#connect.</ol>
     *          <li>Client receives CMD_CHANNEL_HALF_CONNECTED from AsyncChannel</li>
     *      </ol>
     *   <li><code>comm-loop:</code></li>
     *   <li>Client calls AsyncChannel#sendMessage</li>
     *   <li>Server processes messages and optionally replies using AsyncChannel#replyToMessage
     *   <li>Loop to <code>comm-loop</code> until done</li>
     *   <li>When done Client calls {@link AsyncChannel#disconnect}</li>
     *   <li>Client/Server receives CMD_CHANNEL_DISCONNECTED from AsyncChannel</li>
     *</ol>
     *<br/>
     * <p>A second usage model is where the server/destination needs to know
     * which client it's connected too. For example the server needs to
     * send unsolicited messages back to the client. Or the server keeps
     * different state for each client. In this model the server will also
     * use the connect methods. The typical sequence of operation is:</p>
     *<ol>
     *   <li>Client calls AsyncChannel#fullyConnectSync or Asynchronously:<li>
     *      <ol>For an asynchronous full connection it calls AsyncChannel#connect</li>
     *          <li>Client receives CMD_CHANNEL_HALF_CONNECTED from AsyncChannel</li>
     *          <li>Client calls AsyncChannel#sendMessage(CMD_CHANNEL_FULL_CONNECTION)</li>
     *      </ol>
     *   <li>Server receives CMD_CHANNEL_FULL_CONNECTION</li>
     *   <li>Server calls AsyncChannel#connected</li>
     *   <li>Server sends AsyncChannel#sendMessage(CMD_CHANNEL_FULLY_CONNECTED)</li>
     *   <li>Client receives CMD_CHANNEL_FULLY_CONNECTED</li>
     *   <li><code>comm-loop:</code></li>
     *   <li>Client/Server uses AsyncChannel#sendMessage/replyToMessage
     *       to communicate and perform work</li>
     *   <li>Loop to <code>comm-loop</code> until done</li>
     *   <li>When done Client/Server calls {@link AsyncChannel#disconnect}</li>
     *   <li>Client/Server receives CMD_CHANNEL_DISCONNECTED from AsyncChannel</li>
     *</ol>
     *
     * TODO: Consider simplifying where we have connect and fullyConnect with only one response
     * message RSP_CHANNEL_CONNECT instead of two, CMD_CHANNEL_HALF_CONNECTED and
     * CMD_CHANNEL_FULLY_CONNECTED. We'd also change CMD_CHANNEL_FULL_CONNECTION to REQ_CHANNEL_CONNECT.
