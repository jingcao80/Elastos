     /**
     *
     * To enable transitions for a layout container, create a LayoutTransition object and set it on any
     * ViewGroup by calling
     *
     * @sa ViewGroup#setLayoutTransition(LayoutTransition)
     *
     *This will cause
     * default animations to run whenever items are added to or removed from that container. To specify
     * custom animations, use the
     *
     * @sa LayoutTransition#setAnimator(Int32, Animator)
     *
     * setAnimator()} method.
     *
     * <p>One of the core concepts of these transition animations is that there are two types of
     * changes that cause the transition and four different animations that run because of
     * those changes. The changes that trigger the transition are items being added to a container
     * (referred to as an "appearing" transition) or removed from a container (also known as
     * "disappearing"). Setting the visibility of views (between GONE and VISIBLE) will trigger
     * the same add/remove logic. The animations that run due to those events are one that animates
     * items being added, one that animates items being removed, and two that animate the other
     * items in the container that change due to the add/remove occurrence. Users of
     * the transition may want different animations for the changing items depending on whether
     * they are changing due to an appearing or disappearing event, so there is one animation for
     * each of these variations of the changing event. Most of the API of this class is concerned
     * with setting up the basic properties of the animations used in these four situations,
     * or with setting up custom animations for any or all of the four.</p>
     *
     * <p>By default, the DISAPPEARING animation begins immediately, as does the CHANGE_APPEARING
     * animation. The other animations begin after a delay that is set to the default duration
     * of the animations. This behavior facilitates a sequence of animations in transitions as
     * follows: when an item is being added to a layout, the other children of that container will
     * move first (thus creating space for the new item), then the appearing animation will run to
     * animate the item being added. Conversely, when an item is removed from a container, the
     * animation to remove it will run first, then the animations of the other children in the
     * layout will run (closing the gap created in the layout when the item was removed). If this
     * default choreography behavior is not desired, the
     *
     * @sa #setDuration(Int32, Int64)
     *
     * and
     *
     * @sa #setStartDelay(Int32, Int64)
     *
     *of any or all of the animations can be changed as
     * appropriate.</p>
     *
     * <p>The animations specified for the transition, both the defaults and any custom animations
     * set on the transition object, are templates only. That is, these animations exist to hold the
     * basic animation properties, such as the duration, start delay, and properties being animated.
     * But the actual target object, as well as the start and end values for those properties, are
     * set automatically in the process of setting up the transition each time it runs. Each of the
     * animations is cloned from the original copy and the clone is then populated with the dynamic
     * values of the target being animated (such as one of the items in a layout container that is
     * moving as a result of the layout event) as well as the values that are changing (such as the
     * position and size of that object). The actual values that are pushed to each animation
     * depends on what properties are specified for the animation. For example, the default
     * CHANGE_APPEARING animation animates the <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>,
     * <code>bottom</code>, <code>scrollX</code>, and <code>scrollY</code> properties.
     * Values for these properties are updated with the pre- and post-layout
     * values when the transition begins. Custom animations will be similarly populated with
     * the target and values being animated, assuming they use ObjectAnimator objects with
     * property names that are known on the target object.</p>
     *
     * <p>This class, and the associated XML flag for containers, animateLayoutChanges="true",
     * provides a simple utility meant for automating changes in straightforward situations.
     * Using LayoutTransition at multiple levels of a nested view hierarchy may not work due to the
     * interrelationship of the various levels of layout. Also, a container that is being scrolled
     * at the same time as items are being added or removed is probably not a good candidate for
     * this utility, because the before/after locations calculated by LayoutTransition
     * may not match the actual locations when the animations finish due to the container
     * being scrolled as the animations are running. You can work around that
     * particular issue by disabling the 'changing' animations by setting the CHANGE_APPEARING
     * and CHANGE_DISAPPEARING animations to null, and setting the startDelay of the
     * other animations appropriately.</p>
