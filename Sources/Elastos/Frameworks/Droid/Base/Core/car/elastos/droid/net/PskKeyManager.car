     * Provider of key material for pre-shared key (PSK) key exchange used in TLS-PSK cipher suites.
     *
     * <h3>Overview of TLS-PSK</h3>
     *
     * <p>TLS-PSK is a set of TLS/SSL cipher suites which rely on a symmetric pre-shared key (PSK) to
     * secure the TLS/SSL connection and mutually authenticate its peers. These cipher suites may be
     * a more natural fit compared to conventional public key based cipher suites in some scenarios
     * where communication between peers is bootstrapped via a separate step (for example, a pairing
     * step) and requires both peers to authenticate each other. In such scenarios a symmetric key (PSK)
     * can be exchanged during the bootstrapping step, removing the need to generate and exchange public
     * key pairs and X.509 certificates.</p>
     *
     * <p>When a TLS-PSK cipher suite is used, both peers have to use the same key for the TLS/SSL
     * handshake to succeed. Thus, both peers are implicitly authenticated by a successful handshake.
     * This removes the need to use a {@code TrustManager} in conjunction with this {@code KeyManager}.
     * </p>
     *
     * <h3>Supporting multiple keys</h3>
     *
     * <p>A peer may have multiple keys to choose from. To help choose the right key, during the
     * handshake the server can provide a <em>PSK identity hint</em> to the client, and the client can
     * provide a <em>PSK identity</em> to the server. The contents of these two pieces of information
     * are specific to application-level protocols.</p>
     *
     * <p><em>NOTE: Both the PSK identity hint and the PSK identity are transmitted in cleartext.
     * Moreover, these data are received and processed prior to peer having been authenticated. Thus,
     * they must not contain or leak key material or other sensitive information, and should be
     * treated (e.g., parsed) with caution, as untrusted data.</em></p>
     *
     * <p>The high-level flow leading to peers choosing a key during TLS/SSL handshake is as follows:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Server receives a handshake request from client.
     * <li>Server replies, optionally providing a PSK identity hint to client.</li>
     * <li>Client chooses the key.</li>
     * <li>Client provides a PSK identity of the chosen key to server.</li>
     * <li>Server chooses the key.</li>
     * </ol></p>
     *
     * <p>In the flow above, either peer can signal that they do not have a suitable key, in which case
     * the the handshake will be aborted immediately. This may enable a network attacker who does not
     * know the key to learn which PSK identity hints or PSK identities are supported. If this is a
     * concern then a randomly generated key should be used in the scenario where no key is available.
     * This will lead to the handshake aborting later, due to key mismatch -- same as in the scenario
     * where a key is available -- making it appear to the attacker that all PSK identity hints and PSK
     * identities are supported.</p>
     *
     * <h3>Maximum sizes</h3>
     *
     * <p>The maximum supported sizes are as follows:
     * <ul>
     * <li>256 bytes for keys (see {@link #MAX_KEY_LENGTH_BYTES}),</li>
     * <li>128 bytes for PSK identity and PSK identity hint (in modified UTF-8 representation) (see
     * {@link #MAX_IDENTITY_LENGTH_BYTES} and {@link #MAX_IDENTITY_HINT_LENGTH_BYTES}).</li>
     * </ul></p>
     *
     * <h3>Subclassing</h3>
     * Subclasses should normally provide their own implementation of {@code getKey} because the default
     * implementation returns no key, which aborts the handshake.
     *
     * <h3>Example</h3>
     * The following example illustrates how to create an {@code SSLContext} which enables the use of
     * TLS-PSK in {@code SSLSocket}, {@code SSLServerSocket} and {@code SSLEngine} instances obtained
     * from it.
     * <pre> {@code
     * PskKeyManager pskKeyManager = ...;
     *
     * SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
     * sslContext.init(
     *         new KeyManager[] &#123;pskKeyManager&#125;,
     *         new TrustManager[0], // No TrustManagers needed for TLS-PSK
     *         null // Use the default source of entropy
     *         );
     *
     * SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket) sslContext.getSocketFactory().createSocket(...);
     * }</pre>
