     * A listening Bluetooth socket.
     * <p>
     * The interface for Bluetooth Sockets is similar to that of TCP sockets:
     * Socket and ServerSocket. On the server side, use a BluetoothServerSocket
     * to create a listening server socket. When a connection is accepted by the
     * BluetoothServerSocket, it will return a new BluetoothSocket to manage the
     * connection. On the client side, use a single BluetoothSocket to both
     * initiate an outgoing connection and to manage the connection.
     *
     * @sa Socket
     * @sa ServerSocket
     * @sa BluetoothSocket
     * @sa BluetoothServerSocket
     * <p>
     * The most common type of Bluetooth socket is RFCOMM, which is the type
     * supported by the Android APIs. RFCOMM is a connection-oriented, streaming
     * transport over Bluetooth. It is also known as the Serial Port Profile (SPP).
     * <p>
     * To create a listening BluetoothServerSocket that's ready for incoming
     * connections, use BluetoothAdapter.listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord().
     * Then call accept() to listen for incoming connection requests. This call
     * will block until a connection is established, at which point, it will
     * return a BluetoothSocket to manage the connection. Once the
     * BluetoothSocket is acquired, it's a good idea to call close() on the
     * BluetoothServerSocket when it's no longer needed for accepting connections
     *. Closing the BluetoothServerSocket will not close the returned BluetoothSocket.
     *
     * @sa BluetoothServerSocket
     * @sa BluetoothAdapter.listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord()
     * @sa accept()
     * @sa BluetoothServerSocket
     * @sa close()
     * <p>
     * BluetoothServerSocket is thread safe. In particular, close() will always
     * immediately abort ongoing operations and close the server socket.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note</strong>: Requires the BLUETOOTH permission.
