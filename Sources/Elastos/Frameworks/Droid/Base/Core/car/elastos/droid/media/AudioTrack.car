     * The AudioTrack class manages and plays a single audio resource for Java applications.
     * It allows streaming of PCM audio buffers to the audio sink for playback. This is
     * achieved by "pushing" the data to the AudioTrack object using one of the
     *  {@link #write(byte[], int, int)}, {@link #write(short[], int, int)},
     *  and {@link #write(float[], int, int, int)} methods.
     *
     * <p>An AudioTrack instance can operate under two modes: static or streaming.<br>
     * In Streaming mode, the application writes a continuous stream of data to the AudioTrack, using
     * one of the {@code write()} methods. These are blocking and return when the data has been
     * transferred from the Java layer to the native layer and queued for playback. The streaming
     * mode is most useful when playing blocks of audio data that for instance are:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>too big to fit in memory because of the duration of the sound to play,</li>
     *   <li>too big to fit in memory because of the characteristics of the audio data
     *         (high sampling rate, bits per sample ...)</li>
     *   <li>received or generated while previously queued audio is playing.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * The static mode should be chosen when dealing with short sounds that fit in memory and
     * that need to be played with the smallest latency possible. The static mode will
     * therefore be preferred for UI and game sounds that are played often, and with the
     * smallest overhead possible.
     *
     * <p>Upon creation, an AudioTrack object initializes its associated audio buffer.
     * The size of this buffer, specified during the construction, determines how long an AudioTrack
     * can play before running out of data.<br>
     * For an AudioTrack using the static mode, this size is the maximum size of the sound that can
     * be played from it.<br>
     * For the streaming mode, data will be written to the audio sink in chunks of
     * sizes less than or equal to the total buffer size.
     *
     * AudioTrack is not final and thus permits subclasses, but such use is not recommended.
