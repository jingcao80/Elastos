    /**
     * Represents a Bluetooth class, which describes general characteristics
     * and capabilities of a device. For example, a Bluetooth class will
     * specify the general device type such as a phone, a computer, or
     * headset, and whether it's capable of services such as audio or telephony.
     *
     * <p>Every Bluetooth class is composed of zero or more service classes, and
     * exactly one device class. The device class is further broken down into major
     * and minor device class components.
     *
     * <p>{@sa BluetoothClass} is useful as a hint to roughly describe a device
     * (for example to show an icon in the UI), but does not reliably describe which
     * Bluetooth profiles or services are actually supported by a device. Accurate
     * service discovery is done through SDP requests, which are automatically
     * performed when creating an RFCOMM socket with {@sa
     * BluetoothDevice#createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord} and {@sa
     * BluetoothAdapter#listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord}</p>
     *
     * <p>Use {@sa BluetoothDevice#getBluetoothClass} to retrieve the class for
     * a remote device.
     *
     * <!--
     * The Bluetooth class is a 32 bit field. The format of these bits is defined at
     * http://www.bluetooth.org/Technical/AssignedNumbers/baseband.htm
     * (login required). This class contains that 32 bit field, and provides
     * constants and methods to determine which Service Class(es) and Device Class
     * are encoded in that field.
