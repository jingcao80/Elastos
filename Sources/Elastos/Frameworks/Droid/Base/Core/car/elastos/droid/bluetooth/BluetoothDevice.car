     * <p>This class is really just a thin wrapper for a Bluetooth hardware

     * are performed on the remote Bluetooth hardware address, using the
     * {@sa BluetoothAdapter} that was used to create this {@sa
     * BluetoothDevice}.
     *
     * <p>To get a {@sa BluetoothDevice}, use
     * {@sa BluetoothAdapter#getRemoteDevice(String)
     * BluetoothAdapter.getRemoteDevice(String)} to create one representing a device
     * of a known MAC address (which you can get through device discovery with
     * {@sa BluetoothAdapter}) or get one from the set of bonded devices
     * returned by {@sa BluetoothAdapter#getBondedDevices()
     * BluetoothAdapter.getBondedDevices()}. You can then open a
     * {@sa BluetoothSocket} for communication with the remote device, using
     * {@sa #createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord(UUID)}.
