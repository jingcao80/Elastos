    /**
     * A Transition holds information about animations that will be run on its
     * targets during a scene change. Subclasses of this abstract class may
     * choreograph several child transitions ({@link TransitionSet} or they may
     * perform custom animations themselves. Any Transition has two main jobs:
     * (1) capture property values, and (2) play animations based on changes to
     * captured property values. A custom transition knows what property values
     * on View objects are of interest to it, and also knows how to animate
     * changes to those values. For example, the {@link Fade} transition tracks
     * changes to visibility-related properties and is able to construct and run
     * animations that fade items in or out based on changes to those properties.
     *
     * <p>Note: Transitions may not work correctly with either {@link SurfaceView}
     * or {@link TextureView}, due to the way that these views are displayed
     * on the screen. For SurfaceView, the problem is that the view is updated from
     * a non-UI thread, so changes to the view due to transitions (such as moving
     * and resizing the view) may be out of sync with the display inside those bounds.
     * TextureView is more compatible with transitions in general, but some
     * specific transitions (such as {@link Fade}) may not be compatible
     * with TextureView because they rely on {@link ViewOverlay} functionality,
     * which does not currently work with TextureView.</p>
     *
     * <p>Transitions can be declared in XML resource files inside the <code>res/transition</code>
     * directory. Transition resources consist of a tag name for one of the Transition
     * subclasses along with attributes to define some of the attributes of that transition.
     * For example, here is a minimal resource file that declares a {@link ChangeBounds} transition:
     *
     * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/transition/changebounds.xml ChangeBounds}
     *
     * <p>This TransitionSet contains {@link android.transition.Explode} for visibility,
     * {@link android.transition.ChangeBounds}, {@link android.transition.ChangeTransform},
     * and {@link android.transition.ChangeClipBounds} and
     * {@link android.transition.ChangeImageTransform}:</p>
     *
     * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/transition/explode_move_together.xml MultipleTransform}
     *
     * <p>Custom transition classes may be instantiated with a <code>transition</code> tag:</p>
     * <pre>&lt;transition class="my.app.transition.CustomTransition"/></pre>
     * <p>Custom transition classes loaded from XML must have a public nullary (no argument)
     * constructor.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that attributes for the transition are not required, just as they are
     * optional when declared in code; Transitions created from XML resources will use
     * the same defaults as their code-created equivalents. Here is a slightly more
     * elaborate example which declares a {@link TransitionSet} transition with
     * {@link ChangeBounds} and {@link Fade} child transitions:</p>
     *
     * {@sample
     * development/samples/ApiDemos/res/transition/changebounds_fadeout_sequential.xml TransitionSet}
     *
     * <p>In this example, the transitionOrdering attribute is used on the TransitionSet
     * object to change from the default {@link TransitionSet#ORDERING_TOGETHER} behavior
     * to be {@link TransitionSet#ORDERING_SEQUENTIAL} instead. Also, the {@link Fade}
     * transition uses a fadingMode of {@link Fade#OUT} instead of the default
     * out-in behavior. Finally, note the use of the <code>targets</code> sub-tag, which
     * takes a set of {@link android.R.styleable#TransitionTarget target} tags, each
     * of which lists a specific <code>targetId</code>, <code>targetClass</code>,
     * <code>targetName</code>, <code>excludeId</code>, <code>excludeClass</code>, or
     * <code>excludeName</code>, which this transition acts upon.
     * Use of targets is optional, but can be used to either limit the time spent checking
     * attributes on unchanging views, or limiting the types of animations run on specific views.
     * In this case, we know that only the <code>grayscaleContainer</code> will be
     * disappearing, so we choose to limit the {@link Fade} transition to only that view.</p>
     *
     * Further information on XML resource descriptions for transitions can be found for
     * {@link android.R.styleable#Transition}, {@link android.R.styleable#TransitionSet},
     * {@link android.R.styleable#TransitionTarget}, {@link android.R.styleable#Fade},
     * {@link android.R.styleable#Slide}, and {@link android.R.styleable#ChangeTransform}.
