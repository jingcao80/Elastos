     * This class enables automatic and optimized animation of select properties on View objects.
     * If only one or two properties on a View object are being animated, then using an
     * {@link android.animation.ObjectAnimator} is fine; the property setters called by ObjectAnimator
     * are well equipped to do the right thing to set the property and invalidate the view
     * appropriately. But if several properties are animated simultaneously, or if you just want a
     * more convenient syntax to animate a specific property, then ViewPropertyAnimator might be
     * more well-suited to the task.
     *
     * <p>This class may provide better performance for several simultaneous animations, because
     * it will optimize invalidate calls to take place only once for several properties instead of each
     * animated property independently causing its own invalidation. Also, the syntax of using this
     * class could be easier to use because the caller need only tell the View object which
     * property to animate, and the value to animate either to or by, and this class handles the
     * details of configuring the underlying Animator class and starting it.</p>
     *
     * <p>This class is not constructed by the caller, but rather by the View whose properties
     * it will animate. Calls to {@link android.view.View#animate()} will return a reference
     * to the appropriate ViewPropertyAnimator object for that View.</p>
