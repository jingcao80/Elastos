    /**
     * Base class for ExitTransitionCoordinator and EnterTransitionCoordinator, classes
     * that manage activity transitions and the communications coordinating them between
     * Activities. The ExitTransitionCoordinator is created in the
     * ActivityOptions#makeSceneTransitionAnimation. The EnterTransitionCoordinator
     * is created by ActivityOptions#createEnterActivityTransition by Activity when the window is
     * attached.
     *
     * Typical startActivity goes like this:
     * 1) ExitTransitionCoordinator created with ActivityOptions#makeSceneTransitionAnimation
     * 2) Activity#startActivity called and that calls startExit() through
     *    ActivityOptions#dispatchStartExit
     *    - Exit transition starts by setting transitioning Views to INVISIBLE
     * 3) Launched Activity starts, creating an EnterTransitionCoordinator.
     *    - The Window is made translucent
     *    - The Window background alpha is set to 0
     *    - The transitioning views are made INVISIBLE
     *    - MSG_SET_LISTENER is sent back to the ExitTransitionCoordinator.
     * 4) The shared element transition completes.
     *    - MSG_TAKE_SHARED_ELEMENTS is sent to the EnterTransitionCoordinator
     * 5) The MSG_TAKE_SHARED_ELEMENTS is received by the EnterTransitionCoordinator.
     *    - Shared elements are made VISIBLE
     *    - Shared elements positions and size are set to match the end state of the calling
     *      Activity.
     *    - The shared element transition is started
     *    - If the window allows overlapping transitions, the views transition is started by setting
     *      the entering Views to VISIBLE and the background alpha is animated to opaque.
     *    - MSG_HIDE_SHARED_ELEMENTS is sent to the ExitTransitionCoordinator
     * 6) MSG_HIDE_SHARED_ELEMENTS is received by the ExitTransitionCoordinator
     *    - The shared elements are made INVISIBLE
     * 7) The exit transition completes in the calling Activity.
     *    - MSG_EXIT_TRANSITION_COMPLETE is sent to the EnterTransitionCoordinator.
     * 8) The MSG_EXIT_TRANSITION_COMPLETE is received by the EnterTransitionCoordinator.
     *    - If the window doesn't allow overlapping enter transitions, the enter transition is started
     *      by setting entering views to VISIBLE and the background is animated to opaque.
     * 9) The background opacity animation completes.
     *    - The window is made opaque
     * 10) The calling Activity gets an onStop() call
     *    - onActivityStopped() is called and all exited Views are made VISIBLE.
     *
     * Typical finishAfterTransition goes like this:
     * 1) finishAfterTransition() creates an ExitTransitionCoordinator and calls startExit()
     *    - The Window start transitioning to Translucent with a new ActivityOptions.
     *    - If no background exists, a black background is substituted
     *    - The shared elements in the scene are matched against those shared elements
     *      that were sent by comparing the names.
     *    - The exit transition is started by setting Views to INVISIBLE.
     * 2) The ActivityOptions is received by the Activity and an EnterTransitionCoordinator is created.
     *    - All transitioning views are made VISIBLE to reverse what was done when onActivityStopped()
     *      was called
     * 3) The Window is made translucent and a callback is received
     *    - The background alpha is animated to 0
     * 4) The background alpha animation completes
     * 5) The shared element transition completes
     *    - After both 4 & 5 complete, MSG_TAKE_SHARED_ELEMENTS is sent to the
     *      EnterTransitionCoordinator
     * 6) MSG_TAKE_SHARED_ELEMENTS is received by EnterTransitionCoordinator
     *    - Shared elements are made VISIBLE
     *    - Shared elements positions and size are set to match the end state of the calling
     *      Activity.
     *    - The shared element transition is started
     *    - If the window allows overlapping transitions, the views transition is started by setting
     *      the entering Views to VISIBLE.
     *    - MSG_HIDE_SHARED_ELEMENTS is sent to the ExitTransitionCoordinator
     * 7) MSG_HIDE_SHARED_ELEMENTS is received by the ExitTransitionCoordinator
     *    - The shared elements are made INVISIBLE
     * 8) The exit transition completes in the finishing Activity.
     *    - MSG_EXIT_TRANSITION_COMPLETE is sent to the EnterTransitionCoordinator.
     *    - finish() is called on the exiting Activity
     * 9) The MSG_EXIT_TRANSITION_COMPLETE is received by the EnterTransitionCoordinator.
     *    - If the window doesn't allow overlapping enter transitions, the enter transition is started
     *      by setting entering views to VISIBLE.
