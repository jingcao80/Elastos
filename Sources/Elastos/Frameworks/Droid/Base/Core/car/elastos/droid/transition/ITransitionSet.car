     * A TransitionSet is a parent of child transitions (including other
     * TransitionSets). Using TransitionSets enables more complex
     * choreography of transitions, where some sets play {@link #ORDERING_TOGETHER} and
     * others play {@link #ORDERING_SEQUENTIAL}. For example, {@link AutoTransition}
     * uses a TransitionSet to sequentially play a Fade(Fade.OUT), followed by
     * a {@link ChangeBounds}, followed by a Fade(Fade.OUT) transition.
     *
     * <p>A TransitionSet can be described in a resource file by using the
     * tag <code>transitionSet</code>, along with the standard
     * attributes of {@link android.R.styleable#TransitionSet} and
     * {@link android.R.styleable#Transition}. Child transitions of the
     * TransitionSet object can be loaded by adding those child tags inside the
     * enclosing <code>transitionSet</code> tag. For example, the following xml
     * describes a TransitionSet that plays a Fade and then a ChangeBounds
     * transition on the affected view targets:</p>
     * <pre>
     *     &lt;transitionSet xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
     *             android:ordering="sequential"&gt;
     *         &lt;fade/&gt;
     *         &lt;changeBounds/&gt;
     *     &lt;/transitionSet&gt;
     * </pre>
