     * content://authority/path/id
     * content:
     * <p>
     * The scheme portion of the URI. This is always set to ContentResolver.SCHEME_CONTENT (value content://).
     *
     * @sa ContentResolver.SCHEME_CONTENT
     * <p><em>authority</em>
     * <p>
     * A string that identifies the entire content provider. All the content URIs for
     * the provider start with this string. To guarantee a unique authority, providers
     * should consider using an authority that is the same as the provider class'
     * package identifier.
     * <p><em>path</em>
     * <p>
     * Zero or more segments, separated by a forward slash (/), that identify some
     * subset of the provider's data. Most providers use the path part to identify
     * individual tables. Individual segments in the path are often called
     * "directories" although they do not refer to file directories. The right-most
     * segment in a path is often called a "twig"
     * <p><em>id</em>
     * <p>
     * A unique numeric identifier for a single row in the subset of data identified
     * by the preceding path part. Most providers recognize content URIs that contain
     * an id part and give them special handling. A table that contains a column
     * named _ID often expects the id part to be a particular value for that column.
