     * This class holds a time/value pair for an animation. The Keyframe class is
     * used by ValueAnimator to define the values that the animation target will have
     * over the course of the animation. As the time proceeds from one keyframe to
     * the other, the value of the target object will animate between the value at
     * the previous keyframe and the value at the next keyframe. Each keyframe also
     * holds an optional TimeInterpolator object, which defines the time
     * interpolation over the intervalue preceding the keyframe.
     *

     *
     * <p>
     * The Keyframe class itself is abstract. The type-specific factory methods will
     * return a subclass of Keyframe specific to the type of value being stored. This
     * is done to improve performance when dealing with the most common cases (e.g.,
     * float and int values). Other types will fall into a more general Keyframe
     * class that treats its values as Objects. Unless your animation requires
     * dealing with a custom type or a data structure that needs to be animated
     * directly (and evaluated using an implementation of TypeEvaluator), you should
     * stick to using float and int as animations using those types have lower
     * runtime overhead than other types.
