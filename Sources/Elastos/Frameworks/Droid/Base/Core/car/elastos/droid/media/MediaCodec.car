     * codec = null;
     * </pre>
     *
     * Each codec maintains a number of input and output buffers that are
     * referred to by index in API calls.
     * <p>
     * For API levels 20 and below:
     * The contents of these buffers are represented by the ByteBuffer[] arrays
     * accessible through {@link #getInputBuffers} and {@link #getOutputBuffers}.
     * <p>
     * After a successful call to {@link #start} the client "owns" neither
     * input nor output buffers, subsequent calls to {@link #dequeueInputBuffer}
     * and {@link #dequeueOutputBuffer} then transfer ownership from the codec
     * to the client.<p>
     * The client is not required to resubmit/release buffers immediately
     * to the codec, the sample code above simply does this for simplicity's sake.
     * Nonetheless, it is possible that a codec may hold off on generating
     * output buffers until all outstanding buffers have been
     * released/resubmitted.
     * <p>
     * Once the client has an input buffer available it can fill it with data
     * and submit it it to the codec via a call to {@link #queueInputBuffer}.
     * Do not submit multiple input buffers with the same timestamp (unless
     * it is codec-specific data marked as such using the flag
     * {@link #BUFFER_FLAG_CODEC_CONFIG}).
     * <p>
     * The codec in turn will return an output buffer to the client in response
     * to {@link #dequeueOutputBuffer}. After the output buffer has been processed
     * a call to {@link #releaseOutputBuffer} will return it to the codec.
     * If a video surface has been provided in the call to {@link #configure},
     * {@link #releaseOutputBuffer} optionally allows rendering of the buffer
     * to the surface.<p>
     *
     * Input buffers (for decoders) and Output buffers (for encoders) contain
     * encoded data according to the format's type. For video types this data
     * is all the encoded data representing a single moment in time, for audio
     * data this is slightly relaxed in that a buffer may contain multiple
     * encoded frames of audio. In either case, buffers do not start and end on
     * arbitrary byte boundaries, this is not a stream of bytes, it's a stream
     * of access units.<p>
     *
     * Most formats also require the actual data to be prefixed by a number
     * of buffers containing setup data, or codec specific data, i.e. the
     * first few buffers submitted to the codec object after starting it must
     * be codec specific data marked as such using the flag {@link #BUFFER_FLAG_CODEC_CONFIG}
     * in a call to {@link #queueInputBuffer}.
     * <p>
     * Codec specific data included in the format passed to {@link #configure}
     * (in ByteBuffer entries with keys "csd-0", "csd-1", ...) is automatically
     * submitted to the codec, this data MUST NOT be submitted explicitly by the
     * client.
     * <p>
     * Once the client reaches the end of the input data it signals the end of
     * the input stream by specifying a flag of {@link #BUFFER_FLAG_END_OF_STREAM} in the call to
     * {@link #queueInputBuffer}. The codec will continue to return output buffers
     * until it eventually signals the end of the output stream by specifying
     * the same flag ({@link #BUFFER_FLAG_END_OF_STREAM}) on the BufferInfo returned in
     * {@link #dequeueOutputBuffer}.  Do not submit additional input buffers after
     * signaling the end of the input stream, unless the codec has been flushed,
     * or stopped and restarted.
     * <p>
     * <h3>Seeking &amp; Adaptive Playback Support</h3>
     *
     * You can check if a decoder supports adaptive playback via {@link
     * MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities#isFeatureSupported}.  Adaptive playback
     * is only supported if you configure the codec to decode onto a {@link
     * android.view.Surface}.
     *
     * <h4>For decoders that do not support adaptive playback (including
     * when not decoding onto a Surface)</h4>
     *
     * In order to start decoding data that's not adjacent to previously submitted
     * data (i.e. after a seek) <em>one must</em> {@link #flush} the decoder.
     * Any input or output buffers the client may own at the point of the flush are
     * immediately revoked, i.e. after a call to {@link #flush} the client does not
     * own any buffers anymore.
     * <p>
     * It is important that the input data after a flush starts at a suitable
     * stream boundary.  The first frame must be able to be decoded completely on
     * its own (for most codecs this means an I-frame), and that no frames should
     * refer to frames before that first new frame.
     * Note that the format of the data submitted after a flush must not change,
     * flush does not support format discontinuities,
     * for this a full {@link #stop}, {@link #configure configure()}, {@link #start}
     * cycle is necessary.
     *
     * <h4>For decoders that support adaptive playback</h4>
     *
     * In order to start decoding data that's not adjacent to previously submitted
     * data (i.e. after a seek) it is <em>not necessary</em> to {@link #flush} the
     * decoder.
     * <p>
     * It is still important that the input data after the discontinuity starts
     * at a suitable stream boundary (e.g. I-frame), and that no new frames refer
     * to frames before the first frame of the new input data segment.
     * <p>
     * For some video formats it is also possible to change the picture size
     * mid-stream.  To do this for H.264, the new Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) and
     * Picture Parameter Set (PPS) values must be packaged together with an
     * Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (IDR) frame in a single buffer, which then
     * can be enqueued as a regular input buffer.
     * The client will receive an {@link #INFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT_CHANGED} return
     * value from {@link #dequeueOutputBuffer dequeueOutputBuffer()} or
     * {@link Callback#onOutputBufferAvailable onOutputBufferAvailable()}
     * just after the picture-size change takes place and before any
     * frames with the new size have been returned.
     * <p>
     * Be careful when calling {@link #flush} shortly after you have changed
     * the picture size.  If you have not received confirmation of the picture
     * size change, you will need to repeat the request for the new picture size.
     * E.g. for H.264 you will need to prepend the PPS/SPS to the new IDR
     * frame to ensure that the codec receives the picture size change request.
     *
     * <h3>States and error handling</h3>
     *
     * <p> During its life, a codec conceptually exists in one of the following states:
     * Initialized, Configured, Executing, Error, Uninitialized, (omitting transitory states
     * between them). When created by one of the factory methods,
     * the codec is in the Initialized state; {@link #configure} brings it to the
     * Configured state; {@link #start} brings it to the Executing state.
     * In the Executing state, decoding or encoding occurs through the buffer queue
     * manipulation described above. The method {@link #stop}
     * returns the codec to the Initialized state, whereupon it may be configured again,
     * and {@link #release} brings the codec to the terminal Uninitialized state.  When
     * a codec error occurs, the codec moves to the Error state.  Use {@link #reset} to
     * bring the codec back to the Initialized state, or {@link #release} to move it
     * to the Uninitialized state.
     *
     * <p> The factory methods
     * {@link #createByCodecName},
     * {@link #createDecoderByType},
     * and {@link #createEncoderByType}
     * throw {@link java.io.IOException} on failure which
     * the caller must catch or declare to pass up.
     * MediaCodec methods throw {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}
     * when the method is called from a codec state that does not allow it;
     * this is typically due to incorrect application API usage.
     * Methods involving secure buffers may throw
     * {@link MediaCodec.CryptoException#MediaCodec.CryptoException}, which
     * has further error information obtainable from {@link MediaCodec.CryptoException#getErrorCode}.
     *
     * <p> Internal codec errors result in a {@link MediaCodec.CodecException},
     * which may be due to media content corruption, hardware failure, resource exhaustion,
     * and so forth, even when the application is correctly using the API.
     * The recommended action when receiving a {@link MediaCodec.CodecException} can be determined by
     * calling {@link MediaCodec.CodecException#isRecoverable} and
     * {@link MediaCodec.CodecException#isTransient}.
     * If {@link MediaCodec.CodecException#isRecoverable} returns true,
     * then a {@link #stop}, {@link #configure}, and {@link #start} can be performed to recover.
     * If {@link MediaCodec.CodecException#isTransient} returns true,
     * then resources are temporarily unavailable and the method may be retried at a later time.
     * If both {@link MediaCodec.CodecException#isRecoverable}
     * and {@link MediaCodec.CodecException#isTransient} return false,
     * then the {@link MediaCodec.CodecException} is fatal and the codec must be
     * {@link #reset reset} or {@link #release released}.
     * Both {@link MediaCodec.CodecException#isRecoverable} and
     * {@link MediaCodec.CodecException#isTransient} do not return true at the same time.
