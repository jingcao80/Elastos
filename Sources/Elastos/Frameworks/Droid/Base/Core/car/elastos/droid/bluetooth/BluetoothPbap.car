         * Service via IPC.

         * Creating a BluetoothPbap object will create a binding with the
         * BluetoothPbap service. Users of this object should call close() when they
         * are finished with the BluetoothPbap, so that this proxy object can unbind
         * from the service.
         *
         * This BluetoothPbap object is not immediately bound to the
         * BluetoothPbap service. Use the ServiceListener interface to obtain a
         * notification when it is bound, this is especially important if you wish to
         * immediately call methods on BluetoothPbap after construction.
         *
         * Android only supports one connected Bluetooth Pce at a time.
