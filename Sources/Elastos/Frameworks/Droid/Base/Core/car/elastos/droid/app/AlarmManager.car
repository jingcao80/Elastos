     * This class provides access to the system alarm services. These allow you to
     * schedule your application to be run at some point in the future. When an alarm
     * goes off, the Intent that had been registered for it is broadcast by the system,
     * automatically starting the target application if it is not already running.
     * Registered alarms are retained while the device is asleep (and can optionally
     * wake the device up if they go off during that time), but will be cleared if it
     * is turned off and rebooted.
     *
     * @sa Intent
     * <p>
     * The Alarm Manager holds a CPU wake lock as long as the alarm receiver's
     * onReceive() method is executing. This guarantees that the phone will not sleep
     * until you have finished handling the broadcast. Once onReceive() returns, the
     * Alarm Manager releases this wake lock. This means that the phone will in some
     * cases sleep as soon as your onReceive() method completes. If your alarm receiver
     * called Context.startService(), it is possible that the phone will sleep before
     * the requested service is launched. To prevent this, your BroadcastReceiver and
     * Service will need to implement a separate wake lock policy to ensure that the
     * phone continues running until the service becomes available.
