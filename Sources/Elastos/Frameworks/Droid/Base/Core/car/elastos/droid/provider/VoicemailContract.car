     * <P>The content providers exposes two tables through this interface:
     * <ul>
     *   <li> Voicemails table: This stores the actual voicemail records. The
     *   columns and URIs for accessing this table are defined by the
     *   {@link Voicemails} class.
     *   </li>
     *   <li> Status table: This provides a way for the voicemail source application
     *   to convey its current state to the system. The columns and URIS for
     *   accessing this table are defined by the {@link Status} class.
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <P> The minimum permission needed to access this content provider is
     * {@link Manifest.permission#ADD_VOICEMAIL}
     *
     * <P>Voicemails are inserted by what is called as a "voicemail source"
     * application, which is responsible for syncing voicemail data between a remote
     * server and the local voicemail content provider. "voicemail source"
     * application should always set the {@link #PARAM_KEY_SOURCE_PACKAGE} in the
     * URI to identify its package.
     *
     * <P>In addition to the {@link ContentObserver} notifications the voicemail
     * provider also generates broadcast intents to notify change for applications
     * that are not active and therefore cannot listen to ContentObserver
     * notifications. Broadcast intents with following actions are generated:
     * <ul>
     *   <li> {@link #ACTION_NEW_VOICEMAIL} is generated for each new voicemail
     *   inserted.
     *   </li>
     *   <li> {@link Intent#ACTION_PROVIDER_CHANGED} is generated for any change
     *    made into the database, including new voicemail.
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
