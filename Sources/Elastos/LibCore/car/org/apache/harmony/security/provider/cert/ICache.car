    /**
     * The caching mechanism designed to speed up the process
     * of Certificates/CRLs generation in the case of their repeated
     * generation.
     *
     * It keeps correspondences between Objects (Certificates or CLRs)
     * and arrays of bytes on the base of which the Objects have been generated,
     * and provides the means to determine whether it contains the object built on
     * the base of particular encoded form or not. If there are such
     * objects they are returned from the cache, if not - newly generated
     * objects can be saved in the cache.<br>
     *
     * The process of Certificate/CRL generation
     * (implemented in <code>X509CertFactoryImpl</code>) is accompanied with
     * prereading of the beginning of encoded form. This prefix is used to determine
     * whether provided form is PEM encoding or not.<br>
     *
     * So the use of the prefix is the first point to (approximately)
     * determine whether object to be generated is in the cache or not.
     *
     * The failure of the predetermination process tells us that there were not
     * object generated from the encoded form with such prefix and we should
     * generate (decode) the object. If predetermination is successful,
     * we conduct the accurate search on the base of whole encoded form. <br>
     *
     * So to speed up the object generation process this caching mechanism provides
     * the following functionality:<br>
     *
     *      1. With having of the beginning of the encoded form (prefix)
     * it is possible to predetermine whether object has already been
     * generated on the base of the encoding with the SIMILAR prefix or not.
     * This process is not computationally expensive and takes a little time.
     * But it prevents us from use of expensive full encoding
     * search in the case of its failure.<br>
     *
     *      2. If predetermination ends with success, the whole encoding
     * form should be provided to make the final answer: whether object has
     * already been generated on the base of this PARTICULAR encoded form or not.
     * If it is so - the cached object is returned from the cache,
     * if not - new object should be generated and saved in the cache.<br>
     *
     * Note: The length of the prefixes of the encoded forms should not be
     * less than correspondence (default value is 28).
