     * A single input source for an XML entity.

     * <blockquote>
     * <em>This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
     * Public Domain, and comes with <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>.</em>
     * See <a href='http://www.saxproject.org'>http://www.saxproject.org</a>
     * for further information.
     * </blockquote>
     *
     * <p>This class allows a SAX application to encapsulate information
     * about an input source in a single object, which may include
     * a public identifier, a system identifier, a byte stream (possibly
     * with a specified encoding), and/or a character stream.</p>
     *
     * <p>There are two places that the application can deliver an
     * input source to the parser: as the argument to the Parser.parse
     * method, or as the return value of the EntityResolver.resolveEntity
     * method.</p>
     *
     * <p>The SAX parser will use the InputSource object to determine how
     * to read XML input.  If there is a character stream available, the
     * parser will read that stream directly, disregarding any text
     * encoding declaration found in that stream.
     * If there is no character stream, but there is
     * a byte stream, the parser will use that byte stream, using the
     * encoding specified in the InputSource or else (if no encoding is
     * specified) autodetecting the character encoding using an algorithm
     * such as the one in the XML specification.  If neither a character
     * stream nor a
     * byte stream is available, the parser will attempt to open a URI
     * connection to the resource identified by the system
     * identifier.</p>
     *
     * <p>An InputSource object belongs to the application: the SAX parser
     * shall never modify it in any way (it may modify a copy if
     * necessary).  However, standard processing of both byte and
     * character streams is to close them on as part of end-of-parse cleanup,
     * so applications should not attempt to re-use such streams after they
     * have been handed to a parser.  </p>
