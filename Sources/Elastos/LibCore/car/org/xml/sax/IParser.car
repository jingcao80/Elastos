     * <p>This was the main event supplier interface for SAX1; it has
     * been replaced in SAX2 by {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader XMLReader},
     * which includes Namespace support and sophisticated configurability
     * and extensibility.</p>
     *
     * <p>All SAX1 parsers must implement this basic interface: it allows
     * applications to register handlers for different types of events
     * and to initiate a parse from a URI, or a character stream.</p>
     *
     * <p>All SAX1 parsers must also implement a zero-argument constructor
     * (though other constructors are also allowed).</p>
     *
     * <p>SAX1 parsers are reusable but not re-entrant: the application
     * may reuse a parser object (possibly with a different input source)
     * once the first parse has completed successfully, but it may not
     * invoke the parse() methods recursively within a parse.</p>
     *
     * @deprecated This interface has been replaced by the SAX2
     *             {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader XMLReader}
     *             interface, which includes Namespace support.
