     * GregorianCalendar is a concrete subclass of Calendar and provides the
     * standard calendar used by most of the world.
     *
     * @sa Calendar
     * <p>
     * The standard (Gregorian) calendar has 2 eras, BC and AD.
     * <p>
     * This implementation handles a single discontinuity, which corresponds
     * by default to the date the Gregorian calendar was instituted (October
     * 15, 1582 in some countries, later in others). The cutover date may be
     * changed by the caller by calling setGregorianChange().
     * <p>
     * Historically, in those countries which adopted the Gregorian calendar
     * first, October 4, 1582 was thus followed by October 15, 1582. This
     * calendar models this correctly. Before the Gregorian cutover,
     * GregorianCalendar implements the Julian calendar. The only difference
     * between the Gregorian and the Julian calendar is the leap year rule.
     * The Julian calendar specifies leap years every four years, whereas the
     * Gregorian calendar omits century years which are not divisible by 400.
     * <p>
     * GregorianCalendar implements proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendars.
     * That is, dates are computed by extrapolating the current rules
     * indefinitely far backward and forward in time. As a result,
     * GregorianCalendar may be used for all years to generate meaningful and
     * consistent results. However, dates obtained using GregorianCalendar are
     * historically accurate only from March 1, 4 AD onward, when modern
     * Julian calendar rules were adopted. Before this date, leap year rules
     * were applied irregularly, and before 45 BC the Julian calendar did not
     * even exist.
     * Prior to the institution of the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Day was
     * March 25. To avoid confusion, this calendar always uses January 1.
     * A manual adjustment may be made if desired for dates that are prior to
     * the Gregorian changeover and which fall between January 1 and March 24.
     * <p>
     * Values calculated for the WEEK_OF_YEAR field range from 1 to 53. Week 1
     * for a year is the earliest seven day period starting on
     * getFirstDayOfWeek() that contains at least getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()
     * days from that year. It thus depends on the values of
     * getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(), getFirstDayOfWeek(), and the day of the
     * week of January 1. Weeks between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the
     * following year are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (as needed).
     * <p>
     * For example, January 1, 1998 was a Thursday. If getFirstDayOfWeek() is
     * MONDAY and getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() is 4 (these are the values
     * reflecting ISO 8601 and many national standards), then week 1 of 1998
     * starts on December 29, 1997, and ends on January 4, 1998. If, however,
     * getFirstDayOfWeek() is SUNDAY, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January
     * 4, 1998, and ends on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998
     * then are part of week 53 of 1997.
     * <p>
     * Values calculated for the WEEK_OF_MONTH field range from 0 or 1 to 4
     * or 5. Week 1 of a month (the days with WEEK_OF_MONTH = 1) is the
     * earliest set of at least getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() contiguous days
     * in that month, ending on the day before getFirstDayOfWeek(). Unlike
     * week 1 of a year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need
     * not start on getFirstDayOfWeek(), and will not include days of the
     * previous month. Days of a month before week 1 have a WEEK_OF_MONTH of 0.
     * <p>
     * For example, if getFirstDayOfWeek() is SUNDAY and
     * getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() is 4, then the first week of January 1998
     * is Sunday, January 4 through Saturday, January 10. These days have a
     * WEEK_OF_MONTH of 1. Thursday, January 1 through Saturday, January 3
     * have a WEEK_OF_MONTH of 0. If getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() is changed
     * to 3, then January 1 through January 3 have a WEEK_OF_MONTH of 1.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Example:</strong>
     * <pre>
     * // get the supported ids for GMT-08:00 (Pacific Standard Time)
     * String[] ids = TimeZone.getAvailableIDs(-8 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
     * // if no ids were returned, something is wrong. get out.
     * if (ids.length == 0)
     *   System.exit(0);
     *
     * // begin output
     * System.out.println("Current Time");
     *
     * // create a Pacific Standard Time time zone
     * SimpleTimeZone pdt = new SimpleTimeZone(-8 * 60 * 60 * 1000, ids[0]);
     *
     * // set up rules for daylight savings time
     * pdt.setStartRule(Calendar.APRIL, 1, Calendar.SUNDAY, 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
     * pdt.setEndRule(Calendar.OCTOBER, -1, Calendar.SUNDAY, 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
     *
     * // create a GregorianCalendar with the Pacific Daylight time zone
     * // and the current date and time
     * Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar(pdt);
     * Date trialTime = new Date();
