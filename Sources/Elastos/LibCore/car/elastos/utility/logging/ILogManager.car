     * {@code LogManager} is used to maintain configuration properties of the
     * logging framework, and to manage a hierarchical namespace of all named
     * {@code Logger} objects.
     * <p>
     * There is only one global {@code LogManager} instance in the
     * application, which can be get by calling static method
     * {@link #getLogManager()}. This instance is created and
     * initialized during class initialization and cannot be changed.
     * <p>
     * The {@code LogManager} class can be specified by
     * java.util.logging.manager system property, if the property is unavailable or
     * invalid, the default class {@link java.util.logging.LogManager} will
     * be used.
     * <p>
     * On initialization, {@code LogManager} reads its configuration from a
     * properties file, which by default is the "lib/logging.properties" in the JRE
     * directory.
     * <p>
     * However, two optional system properties can be used to customize the initial
     * configuration process of {@code LogManager}.
     * <ul>
     * <li>"java.util.logging.config.class"</li>
     * <li>"java.util.logging.config.file"</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * These two properties can be set in three ways, by the Preferences API, by the
     * "java" command line property definitions, or by system property definitions
     * passed to JNI_CreateJavaVM.
     * <p>
     * The "java.util.logging.config.class" should specifies a class name. If it is
     * set, this given class will be loaded and instantiated during
     * {@code LogManager} initialization, so that this object's default
     * constructor can read the initial configuration and define properties for
     * {@code LogManager}.
     * <p>
     * If "java.util.logging.config.class" property is not set, or it is invalid, or
     * some exception is thrown during the instantiation, then the
     * "java.util.logging.config.file" system property can be used to specify a
     * properties file. The {@code LogManager} will read initial
     * configuration from this file.
     * <p>
     * If neither of these properties is defined, or some exception is thrown
     * during these two properties using, the {@code LogManager} will read
     * its initial configuration from default properties file, as described above.
     * <p>
     * The global logging properties may include:
     * <ul>
     * <li>"handlers". This property's values should be a list of class names for
     * handler classes separated by whitespace, these classes must be subclasses of
     * {@code Handler} and each must have a default constructor, these
     * classes will be loaded, instantiated and registered as handlers on the root
     * {@code Logger} (the {@code Logger} named ""). These
     * {@code Handler}s maybe initialized lazily.</li>
     * <li>"config". The property defines a list of class names separated by
     * whitespace. Each class must have a default constructor, in which it can
     * update the logging configuration, such as levels, handlers, or filters for
     * some logger, etc. These classes will be loaded and instantiated during
     * {@code LogManager} configuration</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * This class, together with any handler and configuration classes associated
     * with it, <b>must</b> be loaded from the system classpath when
     * {@code LogManager} configuration occurs.
     * <p>
     * Besides global properties, the properties for loggers and Handlers can be
     * specified in the property files. The names of these properties will start
     * with the complete dot separated names for the handlers or loggers.
     * <p>
     * In the {@code LogManager}'s hierarchical namespace,
     * {@code Loggers} are organized based on their dot separated names. For
     * example, "x.y.z" is child of "x.y".
     * <p>
     * Levels for {@code Loggers} can be defined by properties whose name end
     * with ".level". Thus "alogger.level" defines a level for the logger named as
     * "alogger" and for all its children in the naming hierarchy. Log levels
     * properties are read and applied in the same order as they are specified in
     * the property file. The root logger's level can be defined by the property
     * named as ".level".
     * <p>
     * This class is thread safe. It is an error to synchronize on a
     * {@code LogManager} while synchronized on a {@code Logger}.
