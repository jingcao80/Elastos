     * A reentrant mutual exclusion {@link Lock} with the same basic
     * behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using
     * {@code synchronized} methods and statements, but with extended
     * capabilities.
     *
     * <p>A {@code ReentrantLock} is <em>owned</em> by the thread last
     * successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
     * {@code lock} will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
     * the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
     * immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
     * be checked using methods {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}, and {@link
     * #getHoldCount}.
     *
     * <p>The constructor for this class accepts an optional
     * <em>fairness</em> parameter.  When set {@code true}, under
     * contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
     * thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
     * access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
     * may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
     * slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
     * variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
     * starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
     * fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
     * fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
     * active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
     * lock.
     * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock() tryLock} method does not
     * honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
     * is available even if other threads are waiting.
     *
     * <p>It is recommended practice to <em>always</em> immediately
     * follow a call to {@code lock} with a {@code try} block, most
     * typically in a before/after construction such as:
     *
     *  <pre> {@code
     * class X {
     *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
     *   // ...
     *
     *   public void m() {
     *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
     *     try {
     *       // ... method body
     *     } finally {
     *       lock.unlock()
     *     }
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * <p>In addition to implementing the {@link Lock} interface, this
     * class defines methods {@code isLocked} and
     * {@code getLockQueueLength}, as well as some associated
     * {@code protected} access methods that may be useful for
     * instrumentation and monitoring.
     *
     * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
     * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
     * its state when serialized.
     *
     * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
     * the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
     * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
