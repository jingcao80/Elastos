     * A {@link java.util.Queue} that additionally supports operations
     * that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an
     * element, and wait for space to become available in the queue when
     * storing an element.
     *
     * <p><tt>BlockingQueue</tt> methods come in four forms, with different ways
     * of handling operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be
     * satisfied at some point in the future:
     * one throws an exception, the second returns a special value (either
     * <tt>null</tt> or <tt>false</tt>, depending on the operation), the third
     * blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed,
     * and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving
     * up.  These methods are summarized in the following table:
     *
     * <p>
     * <table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1>

     * <p>A <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> does not accept <tt>null</tt> elements.
     * Implementations throw <tt>NullPointerException</tt> on attempts
     * to <tt>add</tt>, <tt>put</tt> or <tt>offer</tt> a <tt>null</tt>.  A
     * <tt>null</tt> is used as a sentinel value to indicate failure of
     * <tt>poll</tt> operations.
     *
     * <p>A <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> may be capacity bounded. At any given
     * time it may have a <tt>remainingCapacity</tt> beyond which no
     * additional elements can be <tt>put</tt> without blocking.
     * A <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> without any intrinsic capacity constraints always
     * reports a remaining capacity of <tt>Integer.MAX_VALUE</tt>.
     *
     * <p> <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> implementations are designed to be used
     * primarily for producer-consumer queues, but additionally support
     * the {@link java.util.Collection} interface.  So, for example, it is
     * possible to remove an arbitrary element from a queue using
     * <tt>remove(x)</tt>. However, such operations are in general
     * <em>not</em> performed very efficiently, and are intended for only
     * occasional use, such as when a queued message is cancelled.
     *
     * <p> <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> implementations are thread-safe.  All
     * queuing methods achieve their effects atomically using internal
     * locks or other forms of concurrency control. However, the
     * <em>bulk</em> Collection operations <tt>addAll</tt>,
     * <tt>containsAll</tt>, <tt>retainAll</tt> and <tt>removeAll</tt> are
     * <em>not</em> necessarily performed atomically unless specified
     * otherwise in an implementation. So it is possible, for example, for
     * <tt>addAll(c)</tt> to fail (throwing an exception) after adding
     * only some of the elements in <tt>c</tt>.
     *
     * <p>A <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> does <em>not</em> intrinsically support
     * any kind of &quot;close&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot; operation to
     * indicate that no more items will be added.  The needs and usage of
     * such features tend to be implementation-dependent. For example, a
     * common tactic is for producers to insert special
     * <em>end-of-stream</em> or <em>poison</em> objects, that are
     * interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.
     *
     * <p>
     * Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario.
     * Note that a <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> can safely be used with multiple
     * producers and multiple consumers.
     *  <pre> {@code
     * class Producer implements Runnable {
     *   private final BlockingQueue queue;
     *   Producer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
     *   public void run() {
     *     try {
     *       while (true) { queue.put(produce()); }

     *   private final BlockingQueue queue;
     *   Consumer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
     *   public void run() {
     *     try {
     *       while (true) { consume(queue.take()); }
     *     } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
     *   }
     *   void consume(Object x) { ... }
     * }

     *   void main() {
     *     BlockingQueue q = new SomeQueueImplementation();
     *     Producer p = new Producer(q);
     *     Consumer c1 = new Consumer(q);

     * <p>Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent
     * collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a
     * {@code BlockingQueue}
     * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
     * actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from
     * the {@code BlockingQueue} in another thread.
