    /**
     * Abstract base class for tasks that run within a {@link ForkJoinPool}.
     * A {@code ForkJoinTask} is a thread-like entity that is much
     * lighter weight than a normal thread.  Huge numbers of tasks and
     * subtasks may be hosted by a small number of actual threads in a
     * ForkJoinPool, at the price of some usage limitations.
     *
     * <p>A "main" {@code ForkJoinTask} begins execution when submitted
     * to a {@link ForkJoinPool}.  Once started, it will usually in turn
     * start other subtasks.  As indicated by the name of this class,
     * many programs using {@code ForkJoinTask} employ only methods
     * {@link #fork} and {@link #join}, or derivatives such as {@link
     * #invokeAll(ForkJoinTask...) invokeAll}.  However, this class also
     * provides a number of other methods that can come into play in
     * advanced usages, as well as extension mechanics that allow
     * support of new forms of fork/join processing.
     *
     * <p>A {@code ForkJoinTask} is a lightweight form of {@link Future}.
     * The efficiency of {@code ForkJoinTask}s stems from a set of
     * restrictions (that are only partially statically enforceable)
     * reflecting their intended use as computational tasks calculating
     * pure functions or operating on purely isolated objects.  The
     * primary coordination mechanisms are {@link #fork}, that arranges
     * asynchronous execution, and {@link #join}, that doesn't proceed
     * until the task's result has been computed.  Computations should
     * avoid {@code synchronized} methods or blocks, and should minimize
     * other blocking synchronization apart from joining other tasks or
     * using synchronizers such as Phasers that are advertised to
     * cooperate with fork/join scheduling. Tasks should also not perform
     * blocking IO, and should ideally access variables that are
     * completely independent of those accessed by other running
     * tasks. Minor breaches of these restrictions, for example using
     * shared output streams, may be tolerable in practice, but frequent
     * use may result in poor performance, and the potential to
     * indefinitely stall if the number of threads not waiting for IO or
     * other external synchronization becomes exhausted. This usage
     * restriction is in part enforced by not permitting checked
     * exceptions such as {@code IOExceptions} to be thrown. However,
     * computations may still encounter unchecked exceptions, that are
     * rethrown to callers attempting to join them. These exceptions may
     * additionally include {@link RejectedExecutionException} stemming
     * from internal resource exhaustion, such as failure to allocate
     * internal task queues. Rethrown exceptions behave in the same way as
     * regular exceptions, but, when possible, contain stack traces (as
     * displayed for example using {@code ex.printStackTrace()}) of both
     * the thread that initiated the computation as well as the thread
     * actually encountering the exception; minimally only the latter.
     *
     * <p>The primary method for awaiting completion and extracting
     * results of a task is {@link #join}, but there are several variants:
     * The {@link Future#get} methods support interruptible and/or timed
     * waits for completion and report results using {@code Future}
     * conventions. Method {@link #invoke} is semantically
     * equivalent to {@code fork(); join()} but always attempts to begin
     * execution in the current thread. The "<em>quiet</em>" forms of
     * these methods do not extract results or report exceptions. These
     * may be useful when a set of tasks are being executed, and you need
     * to delay processing of results or exceptions until all complete.
     * Method {@code invokeAll} (available in multiple versions)
     * performs the most common form of parallel invocation: forking a set
     * of tasks and joining them all.
     *
     * <p>The execution status of tasks may be queried at several levels
     * of detail: {@link #isDone} is true if a task completed in any way
     * (including the case where a task was cancelled without executing);
     * {@link #isCompletedNormally} is true if a task completed without
     * cancellation or encountering an exception; {@link #isCancelled} is
     * true if the task was cancelled (in which case {@link #getException}
     * returns a {@link java.util.concurrent.CancellationException}); and
     * {@link #isCompletedAbnormally} is true if a task was either
     * cancelled or encountered an exception, in which case {@link
     * #getException} will return either the encountered exception or
     * {@link java.util.concurrent.CancellationException}.
     *
     * <p>The ForkJoinTask class is not usually directly subclassed.
     * Instead, you subclass one of the abstract classes that support a
     * particular style of fork/join processing, typically {@link
     * RecursiveAction} for computations that do not return results, or
     * {@link RecursiveTask} for those that do.  Normally, a concrete
     * ForkJoinTask subclass declares fields comprising its parameters,
     * established in a constructor, and then defines a {@code compute}
     * method that somehow uses the control methods supplied by this base
     * class. While these methods have {@code public} access (to allow
     * instances of different task subclasses to call each other's
     * methods), some of them may only be called from within other
     * ForkJoinTasks (as may be determined using method {@link
     * #inForkJoinPool}).  Attempts to invoke them in other contexts
     * result in exceptions or errors, possibly including
     * {@code ClassCastException}.
     *
     * <p>Method {@link #join} and its variants are appropriate for use
     * only when completion dependencies are acyclic; that is, the
     * parallel computation can be described as a directed acyclic graph
     * (DAG). Otherwise, executions may encounter a form of deadlock as
     * tasks cyclically wait for each other.  However, this framework
     * supports other methods and techniques (for example the use of
     * {@link Phaser}, {@link #helpQuiesce}, and {@link #complete}) that
     * may be of use in constructing custom subclasses for problems that
     * are not statically structured as DAGs.
     *
     * <p>Most base support methods are {@code final}, to prevent
     * overriding of implementations that are intrinsically tied to the
     * underlying lightweight task scheduling framework.  Developers
     * creating new basic styles of fork/join processing should minimally
     * implement {@code protected} methods {@link #exec}, {@link
     * #setRawResult}, and {@link #getRawResult}, while also introducing
     * an abstract computational method that can be implemented in its
     * subclasses, possibly relying on other {@code protected} methods
     * provided by this class.
     *
     * <p>ForkJoinTasks should perform relatively small amounts of
     * computation. Large tasks should be split into smaller subtasks,
     * usually via recursive decomposition. As a very rough rule of thumb,
     * a task should perform more than 100 and less than 10000 basic
     * computational steps, and should avoid indefinite looping. If tasks
     * are too big, then parallelism cannot improve throughput. If too
     * small, then memory and internal task maintenance overhead may
     * overwhelm processing.
     *
     * <p>This class provides {@code adapt} methods for {@link Runnable}
     * and {@link Callable}, that may be of use when mixing execution of
     * {@code ForkJoinTasks} with other kinds of tasks. When all tasks are
     * of this form, consider using a pool constructed in <em>asyncMode</em>.
     *
     * <p>ForkJoinTasks are {@code Serializable}, which enables them to be
     * used in extensions such as remote execution frameworks. It is
     * sensible to serialize tasks only before or after, but not during,
     * execution. Serialization is not relied on during execution itself.
