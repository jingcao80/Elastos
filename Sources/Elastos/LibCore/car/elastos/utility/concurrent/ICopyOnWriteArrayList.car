     * A thread-safe random-access list.
     *
     * <p>Read operations (including {@link #get}) do not block and may overlap with
     * update operations. Reads reflect the results of the most recently completed
     * operations. Aggregate operations like {@link #addAll} and {@link #clear} are
     * atomic; they never expose an intermediate state.
     *
     * <p>Iterators of this list never throw {@link
     * ConcurrentModificationException}. When an iterator is created, it keeps a
     * copy of the list's contents. It is always safe to iterate this list, but
     * iterations may not reflect the latest state of the list.
     *
     * <p>Iterators returned by this list and its sub lists cannot modify the
     * underlying list. In particular, {@link Iterator#remove}, {@link
     * ListIterator#add} and {@link ListIterator#set} all throw {@link
     * UnsupportedOperationException}.
     *
     * <p>This class offers extended API beyond the {@link List} interface. It
     * includes additional overloads for indexed search ({@link #indexOf} and {@link
     * #lastIndexOf}) and methods for conditional adds ({@link #addIfAbsent} and
     * {@link #addAllAbsent}).
