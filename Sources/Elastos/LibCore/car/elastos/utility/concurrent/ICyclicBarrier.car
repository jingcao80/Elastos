    /**
     * A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for
     * each other to reach a common barrier point.  CyclicBarriers are
     * useful in programs involving a fixed sized party of threads that
     * must occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called
     * <em>cyclic</em> because it can be re-used after the waiting threads
     * are released.
     *
     * <p>A <tt>CyclicBarrier</tt> supports an optional {@link Runnable} command
     * that is run once per barrier point, after the last thread in the party
     * arrives, but before any threads are released.
     * This <em>barrier action</em> is useful
     * for updating shared-state before any of the parties continue.
     *
     * <p><b>Sample usage:</b> Here is an example of
     *  using a barrier in a parallel decomposition design:
     *
     *  <pre> {@code
     * class Solver {
     *   final int N;
     *   final float[][] data;
     *   final CyclicBarrier barrier;
     *
     *   class Worker implements Runnable {
     *     int myRow;
     *     Worker(int row) { myRow = row; }
     *     public void run() {
     *       while (!done()) {
     *         processRow(myRow);
     *
     *         try {
     *           barrier.await();
     *         } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
     *           return;
     *         } catch (BrokenBarrierException ex) {
     *           return;
     *         }
     *       }
     *     }
     *   }
     *
     *   public Solver(float[][] matrix) {
     *     data = matrix;
     *     N = matrix.length;
     *     barrier = new CyclicBarrier(N,
     *                                 new Runnable() {
     *                                   public void run() {
     *                                     mergeRows(...);
     *                                   }
     *                                 });
     *     for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
     *       new Thread(new Worker(i)).start();
     *
     *     waitUntilDone();
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * Here, each worker thread processes a row of the matrix then waits at the
     * barrier until all rows have been processed. When all rows are processed
     * the supplied {@link Runnable} barrier action is executed and merges the
     * rows. If the merger
     * determines that a solution has been found then <tt>done()</tt> will return
     * <tt>true</tt> and each worker will terminate.
     *
     * <p>If the barrier action does not rely on the parties being suspended when
     * it is executed, then any of the threads in the party could execute that
     * action when it is released. To facilitate this, each invocation of
     * {@link #await} returns the arrival index of that thread at the barrier.
     * You can then choose which thread should execute the barrier action, for
     * example:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * if (barrier.await() == 0) {
     *   // log the completion of this iteration
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * <p>The <tt>CyclicBarrier</tt> uses an all-or-none breakage model
     * for failed synchronization attempts: If a thread leaves a barrier
     * point prematurely because of interruption, failure, or timeout, all
     * other threads waiting at that barrier point will also leave
     * abnormally via {@link BrokenBarrierException} (or
     * {@link InterruptedException} if they too were interrupted at about
     * the same time).
     *
     * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
     * {@code await()}
     * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
     * actions that are part of the barrier action, which in turn
     * <i>happen-before</i> actions following a successful return from the
     * corresponding {@code await()} in other threads.
