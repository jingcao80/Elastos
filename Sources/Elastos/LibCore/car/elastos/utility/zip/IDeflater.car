     * This class compresses data using the <i>DEFLATE</i> algorithm (see <a
     * href="http://www.gzip.org/algorithm.txt">specification</a>).
     *
     * <p>It is usually more convenient to use {@link DeflaterOutputStream}.
     *
     * <p>To compress an in-memory {@code byte[]} to another in-memory {@code byte[]} manually:
     * <pre>
     *     byte[] originalBytes = ...
     *
     *     Deflater deflater = new Deflater();
     *     deflater.setInput(originalBytes);
     *     deflater.finish();
     *
     *     ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
     *     byte[] buf = new byte[8192];
     *     while (!deflater.finished()) {
     *         int byteCount = deflater.deflate(buf);
     *         baos.write(buf, 0, byteCount);
     *     }
     *     deflater.end();
     *
     *     byte[] compressedBytes = baos.toByteArray();
     * </pre>
     * <p>In situations where you don't have all the input in one array (or have so much
     * input that you want to feed it to the deflater in chunks), it's possible to call
     * {@link #setInput setInput} repeatedly, but you're much better off using
     * {@link DeflaterOutputStream} to handle all this for you. {@link DeflaterOutputStream} also helps
     * minimize memory requirements&nbsp;&mdash; the sample code above is very expensive.
     *
     * <a name="compression_level"><h3>Compression levels</h3></a>
     * <p>A compression level must be {@link #DEFAULT_COMPRESSION} to compromise between speed and
     * compression (currently equivalent to level 6), or between 0 ({@link #NO_COMPRESSION}, where
     * the input is simply copied) and 9 ({@link #BEST_COMPRESSION}). Level 1 ({@link #BEST_SPEED})
     * performs some compression, but with minimal speed overhead.
