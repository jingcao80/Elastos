     * A service-provider loader.
     *
     * <p>A service provider is a factory for creating all known implementations of a particular
     * class or interface {@code S}. The known implementations are read from a configuration file in
     * {@code META-INF/services/}. The file's name should match the class' binary name (such as
     * {@code java.util.Outer$Inner}).
     *
     * <p>The file format is as follows.
     * The file's character encoding must be UTF-8.
     * Whitespace is ignored, and {@code #} is used to begin a comment that continues to the
     * next newline.
     * Lines that are empty after comment removal and whitespace trimming are ignored.
     * Otherwise, each line contains the binary name of one implementation class.
     * Duplicate entries are ignored, but entries are otherwise returned in order (that is, the file
     * is treated as an ordered set).
     *
     * <p>Given these classes:
     * <pre>
     * package a.b.c;
     * public interface MyService { ... }
     * public class MyImpl1 implements MyService { ... }
     * public class MyImpl2 implements MyService { ... }
     * </pre>
     * And this configuration file (stored as {@code META-INF/services/a.b.c.MyService}):
     * <pre>
     * # Known MyService providers.
     * a.b.c.MyImpl1  # The original implementation for handling "bar"s.
     * a.b.c.MyImpl2  # A later implementation for "foo"s.
     * </pre>
     * You might use {@code ServiceProvider} something like this:
     * <pre>
     *   for (MyService service : ServiceLoader<MyService>.load(MyService.class)) {
     *     if (service.supports(o)) {
     *       return service.handle(o);
     *     }
     *   }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Note that each iteration creates new instances of the various service implementations, so
     * any heavily-used code will likely want to cache the known implementations itself and reuse them.
     * Note also that the candidate classes are instantiated lazily as you call {@code next} on the
     * iterator: construction of the iterator itself does not instantiate any of the providers.
     *
     * @param <S> the service class or interface
     * @since 1.6
