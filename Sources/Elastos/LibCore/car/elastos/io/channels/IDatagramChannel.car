     * <p>
     * A datagram channel is open but not connected when created with the
     * { open()} method. After it is connected, it will keep the connected
     * status until it is disconnected or closed. The benefit of a connected channel
     * is the reduced effort of security checks during send and receive. When
     * invoking { read} or { write}, a connected channel is required.
     * <p>
     * Datagram channels are thread-safe; only one thread can read or write at the
     * same time.
