     * A converter that can convert a byte sequence from a charset into a 16-bit
     * Unicode character sequence.
     * <p>
     * The input byte sequence is wrapped by a
     * ByteBuffer and the output character sequence is a CharBuffer.
     *
     * @sa java.nio.ByteBuffer ByteBuffer
     * @sa java.nio.CharBuffer CharBuffer
     * A decoder instance should be used in
     * the following sequence, which is referred to as a decoding operation:
     * <ol>
     * <li>invoking the reset method to reset the decoder if the
     * decoder has been used;</li>
     *
     * @sa #reset() reset
     * <li>invoking the decode
     * method until the additional input is not needed, the <code>endOfInput</code>
     * parameter must be set to false, the input buffer must be filled and the
     * output buffer must be flushed between invocations;</li>
     *
     * @sa #decode(ByteBuffer, CharBuffer, boolean) decode
     * <li>invoking the decode
     * method for the last time, and then the <code>endOfInput</code> parameter

     * <li>invoking the flush method to flush the
     * output.</li>
     *
     * @sa #flush(CharBuffer) flush
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * The decode method will
     * convert as many bytes as possible, and the process won't stop until the input
     * bytes have run out, the output buffer has been filled or some error has
     * happened.

     * A CoderResult instance will be returned to
     * indicate the stop reason, and the invoker can identify the result and choose
     * further action, which includes filling the input buffer, flushing the output
     * buffer or recovering from an error and trying again.
     *
     * @sa CoderResult CoderResult
     * <p>
     * There are two common decoding errors. One is named malformed and it is
     * returned when the input byte sequence is illegal for the current specific
     * charset, the other is named unmappable character and it is returned when a
     * problem occurs mapping a legal input byte sequence to its Unicode character
     * equivalent.
     * <p>
     * Both errors can be handled in three ways, the default one is to report the
     * error to the invoker by a CoderResult instance, and the
     * alternatives are to ignore it or to replace the erroneous input with the
     * replacement string.
     *
     * @sa CoderResult CoderResult
     * The replacement string is "\uFFFD" by default and can be
     * changed by invoking replaceWith} method.
     *
     * @sa #replaceWith(String) replaceWith
     * The
     * invoker of this decoder can choose one way by specifying a
     * CodingErrorAction instance for each error type via onMalformedInput method and
     * onUnmappableCharacter method.

     * This is an abstract class and encapsulates many common operations of the
     * decoding process for all charsets. Decoders for a specific charset should
     * extend this class and need only to implement the
