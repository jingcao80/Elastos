     * A buffer is a list of elements of a specific primitive type.
     * <p>
     * A buffer can be described by the following properties:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Capacity: the number of elements a buffer can hold. Capacity may not be
     * negative and never changes.</li>
     * <li>Position: a cursor of this buffer. Elements are read or written at the
     * position if you do not specify an index explicitly. Position may not be
     * negative and not greater than the limit.</li>
     * <li>Limit: controls the scope of accessible elements. You can only read or
     * write elements from index zero to <code>limit - 1</code>. Accessing
     * elements out of the scope will cause an exception. Limit may not be negative
     * and not greater than capacity.</li>
     * <li>Mark: used to remember the current position, so that you can reset the
     * position later. Mark may not be negative and no greater than position.</li>
     * <li>A buffer can be read-only or read-write. Trying to modify the elements
     * of a read-only buffer will cause a <code>ReadOnlyBufferException</code>,
     * while changing the position, limit and mark of a read-only buffer is OK.</li>
     * <li>A buffer can be direct or indirect. A direct buffer will try its best to
     * take advantage of native memory APIs and it may not stay in the Java heap,
     * thus it is not affected by garbage collection.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Buffers are not thread-safe. If concurrent access to a buffer instance is
     * required, then the callers are responsible to take care of the
     * synchronization issues.
