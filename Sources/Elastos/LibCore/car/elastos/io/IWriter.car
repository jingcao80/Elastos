     *The base class for all writers. A writer is a means of writing data to a target in a character-wise
     *manner. Most output streams expect the flush() method to be called before closing the stream, to
     *ensure all data is actually written out.
     *<p>
     *This abstract class does not provide a fully working implementation, so it needs to be subclassed,
     *and at least the write(char[], int, int), close() and flush() methods needs to be overridden.
     *Overriding some of the non-abstract methods is also often advised, since it might result in higher
     *efficiency.

     *Many specialized readers for purposes like reading from a file already exist in this package.
