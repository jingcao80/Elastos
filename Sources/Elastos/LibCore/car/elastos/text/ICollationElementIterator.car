     * Created by a RuleBasedCollator to iterate through a string. The result of each
     * iteration is a 32-bit collation element that defines the ordering priority of
     * the next character or sequence of characters in the source string.
     * <p>
     * For illustration, consider the following in Spanish:
     * <p>
     * "ca": the first collation element is collation_element('c') and second
     * collation element is collation_element('a').
     * <p>
     * Since "ch" in Spanish sorts as one entity, the example below returns one
     * collation element for the two characters 'c' and 'h':
     * <p>
     * "cha": the first collation element is collation_element('ch') and the second
     * one is collation_element('a').
     * <p>
     * In German, since the character '\u0086' is a composed character of 'a' and 'e',
     * the iterator returns two collation elements for the single character '\u0086':
     * <p>
     * "\u0086b": the first collation element is collation_element('a'), the second
     * one is collation_element('e'), and the third collation element is
     * collation_element('b').
