    /**
     * Locates boundaries in text. This class defines a protocol for objects that
     * break up a piece of natural-language text according to a set of criteria.
     * Instances or subclasses of BreakIterator can be provided, for example, to break
     * a piece of text into words, sentences, or logical characters according to the
     * conventions of some language or group of languages. We provide four built-in
     * types of BreakIterator:
     * <p>
     * <li>getSentenceInstance() returns a BreakIterator that locates boundaries between
     * sentences. This is useful for triple-click selection, for example.</li>
     *
     * @sa getSentenceInstance()
     * <p>
     * <li>getWordInstance() returns a BreakIterator that locates boundaries between
     * words. This is useful for double-click selection or "find whole words" searches.
     * This type of BreakIterator makes sure there is a boundary position at the
     * beginning and end of each legal word (numbers count as words, too). Whitespace
     * and punctuation are kept separate from real words.</li>
     *
     * @sa getWordInstance()
     * <p>
     * <li>getLineInstance() returns a BreakIterator that locates positions where it is
     * legal for a text editor to wrap lines. This is similar to word breaking, but
     * not the same: punctuation and whitespace are generally kept with words (you
     * don't want a line to start with whitespace, for example), and some special
     * characters can force a position to be considered a line break position or
     * prevent a position from being a line break position.</li>
     * <p>
     * <li>getCharacterInstance() returns a BreakIterator that locates boundaries
     * between logical characters. Because of the structure of the Unicode encoding, a
     * logical character may be stored internally as more than one Unicode code point.
     * (A with an umlaut may be stored as an a followed by a separate combining umlaut
     * character, for example, but the user still thinks of it as one character.) This
     * iterator allows various processes (especially text editors) to treat as
     * characters the units of text that a user would think of as characters, rather
     * than the units of text that the computer sees as "characters".</li>
     * <p>
     * BreakIterator's interface follows an "iterator" model (hence the name), meaning
     * it has a concept of a "current position" and methods like first(), last(),
     * next(), and previous() that update the current position. All BreakIterators
     * uphold the following invariants:
     * <p>
     * <li>The beginning and end of the text are always treated as boundary positions.
     * The current position of the iterator is always a boundary position
     * (random- access methods move the iterator to the nearest boundary position
     * before or after the specified position, not to the specified position).</li>
     * <p>
     * <li>DONE is used as a flag to indicate when iteration has stopped. DONE is only
     * returned when the current position is the end of the text and the user calls
     * next(), or when the current position is the beginning of the text and the user
     * calls previous().</li>
     * <p>
     * <li>Break positions are numbered by the positions of the characters that follow
     * them. Thus, under normal circumstances, the position before the first character
     * is 0, the position after the first character is 1, and the position after the
     * last character is 1 plus the length of the string.</li>
     * <p>
     * <li>The client can change the position of an iterator, or the text it analyzes, at
     * will, but cannot change the behavior. If the user wants different behavior, he
     * must instantiate a new iterator.</li>
     * <p>
     * BreakIterator accesses the text it analyzes through a CharacterIterator, which
     * makes it possible to use BreakIterator to analyze text in any text-storage
     * vehicle that provides a CharacterIterator interface.
     *
     * @sa CharacterIterator
     * <p>
     * <em>Note</em>: Some types of BreakIterator can take a long time to create,
     * and instances of BreakIterator are not currently cached by the system.
     * For optimal performance, keep instances of BreakIterator around as long as it
     * makes sense. For example, when word-wrapping a document, don't create and destroy
     * a new BreakIterator for each line. Create one break iterator for the whole
     * document (or whatever stretch of text you're wrapping) and use it to do the whole
     * job of wrapping the text.
     * <p>
     * <em>Examples:</em>
     * <p>
     * Creating and using text boundaries:
     * <pre>
     * public static void main(String args[]) {
     * if (args.length == 1) {
     *    String stringToExamine = args[0];
     *    //print each word in order
     *    BreakIterator boundary = BreakIterator.getWordInstance();
     *    boundary.setText(stringToExamine);
     *    printEachForward(boundary, stringToExamine);
     *    //print each sentence in reverse order
     *    boundary = BreakIterator.getSentenceInstance(Locale.US);
     *    boundary.setText(stringToExamine);
     *    printEachBackward(boundary, stringToExamine);
     *    printFirst(boundary, stringToExamine);
     *    printLast(boundary, stringToExamine);
     *  }
     *  }
     * </pre>
     * Print each element in order:
     * <pre>
     * public static void printEachForward(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
     * int start = boundary.first();
     * for (int end = boundary.next(); end != BreakIterator.DONE; start = end, end = boundary.next()) {
     *    System.out.println(source.substring(start, end));
     *   }
     *  }
     * </pre>
     * Print each element in reverse order:
     * <pre>
     * public static void printEachBackward(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
     * int end = boundary.last();
     * for (int start = boundary.previous(); start != BreakIterator.DONE; end = start, start = boundary.previous()) {
     *    System.out.println(source.substring(start, end));
     *  }
     * }
     * </pre>
     * Print the first element:
     * <pre>
     * public static void printFirst(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
     * int start = boundary.first();
     * int end = boundary.next();
     * System.out.println(source.substring(start, end));
     * }
     * </pre>
     * Print the last element:
     * <pre>
     * public static void printLast(BreakIterator boundary, String source) {
     * int end = boundary.last();
     * int start = boundary.previous();
     * System.out.println(source.substring(start, end));
     * }
     * </pre>
     * Print the element at a specified position:
     * <pre>
     * public static void printAt(BreakIterator boundary, int pos, String source) {
     * int end = boundary.following(pos);
     * int start = boundary.previous();
     * System.out.println(source.substring(start, end));
     * }
     * </pre>
     * Find the next word:
     * <pre>
     * public static int nextWordStartAfter(int pos, String text) {
     * BreakIterator wb = BreakIterator.getWordInstance();
     * wb.setText(text);
     * int last = wb.following(pos);
     * int current = wb.next();
     * while (current != BreakIterator.DONE) {
     *    for (int p = last; p < current; p++) {
     *        if (Character.isLetter(text.charAt(p)))
     *            return last;
     *    }
     *    last = current;
     *    current = wb.next();
     * }
     * return BreakIterator.DONE;
     * }
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * The iterator returned by BreakIterator.getWordInstance() is unique in that the
     * break positions it returns don't represent both the start and end of the thing
     * being iterated over. That is, a sentence-break iterator returns breaks that
     * each represent the end of one sentence and the beginning of the next. With the
     * word-break iterator, the characters between two boundaries might be a word, or
     * they might be the punctuation or whitespace between two words. The above code
     * uses a simple heuristic to determine which boundary is the beginning of a word:
     * If the characters between this boundary and the next boundary include at least
     * one letter (this can be an alphabetical letter, a CJK ideograph, a Hangul
     * syllable, a Kana character, etc.), then the text between this boundary and the
     * next is a word; otherwise, it's the material between words.)
