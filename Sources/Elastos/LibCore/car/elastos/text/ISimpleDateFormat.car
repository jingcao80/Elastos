    /**
     * Formats and parses dates in a locale-sensitive manner. Formatting turns a Date into a String, and parsing turns a String into a Date.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Time Pattern Syntax</strong>
     * <p>
     * You can supply a Unicode UTS #35 pattern describing what strings are
     * produced/accepted, but almost all callers should use getDateInstance(),
     * getDateTimeInstance(), or getTimeInstance() to get a ready-made
     * instance suitable for the user's locale. In cases where the system does
     * not provide a suitable pattern, see
     * getBestDateTimePattern(Locale, String) which lets you specify the
     * elements you'd like in a pattern and get back a pattern suitable for any given locale.
     *
     * @sa UTS #35
     * @sa getDateInstance()
     * @sa getDateTimeInstance()
     * @sa getTimeInstance()
     * @sa getBestDateTimePattern(Locale, String)
     *
     * <p>
     * The main reason you'd create an instance this class directly is because
     * you need to format/parse a specific machine-readable format, in which
     * case you almost certainly want to explicitly ask for US to ensure that
     * you get ASCII digits (rather than, say, Arabic digits). (See "Be wary
     * of the default locale".) The most useful non-localized pattern is
     * "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSZ", which corresponds to the ISO 8601
     * international standard date format.
     *
     * @sa US
     * @sa Be wary of the default locale
     * <p>
     * To specify the time format, use a time pattern string. In this string,
     * any character from 'A' to 'Z' or 'a' to 'z' is treated specially. All
     * other characters are passed through verbatim. The interpretation of
     * each of the ASCII letters is given in the table below. ASCII letters
     * not appearing in the table are reserved for future use, and it is an
     * error to attempt to use them.
     * <p>
     * The number of consecutive copies (the "count") of a pattern character
     * further influences the format, as shown in the table. For fields of
     * kind "number", the count is the minimum number of digits; shorter
     * values are zero-padded to the given width and longer values overflow it.
     * <p>
     * Symbol | Meaning | Kind | Example
     * :-|:------------|:-------|:---------|
     * D  |  day in year | (Number) |   189
     * E  | day of week | (Text) | E/EE/EEE:Tue, EEEE:Tuesday, EEEEE:T
     * F  | day of week in month  |  (Number)  |  2 (2nd Wed in July)
     * G  | era designator | (Text)  AD
     * H  | hour in day (0-23) | (Number)  |  0

     * S  | fractional seconds | (Number)  |   978
     * W  | week in month  | (Number) |   2
     * Z  | time zone (RFC 822) | (Time Zone) | Z/ZZ/ZZZ:-0800 ZZZZ:GMT-08:00 ZZZZZ:-08:00
     * a  | am/pm marker  |  (Text) | PM
     * c  | stand-alone day of week | (Text) | c/cc/ccc:Tue, cccc:Tuesday, ccccc:T
     * d  | day in month  |  (Number)  |  10
     * h  | hour in am/pm (1-12)  |  (Number)  |  12
     * k  | hour in day (1-24) | (Number) |   24
     * m  | minute in hour | (Number)  |  30
     * s  | second in minute  |  (Number) |   55
     * w  | week in year |   (Number)  |  27
     * y  | year  |  (Number)  |  yy:10 y/yyy/yyyy:2010
     * z  | time zone  | (Timezone) | z/zz/zzz:PST zzzz:Pacific Standard Time
     * '  | escape for text | (Delimiter) | 'Date=':Date=
     * '' | single quote |   (Literal)  | 'o''clock':o'clock
     * <p>
     * Fractional seconds are handled specially: they're zero-padded on the <em>right</em>.
     * <p>
     * The two pattern characters L and c are ICU-compatible extensions, not
     * available in the RI or in Android before Android 2.3 "Gingerbread"
     * (API level 9). These extensions are necessary for correct localization
     * in languages such as Russian that make a grammatical distinction
     * between, say, the word "June" in the sentence "June" and in the
     * sentence "June 10th"; the former is the stand-alone form, the latter
     * the regular form (because the usual case is to format a complete date).
     * The relationship between E and c is equivalent, but for weekday names.
     * <p>
     * Five-count patterns (such as "MMMMM") used for the shortest
     * non-numeric representation of a field were introduced in Jelly Bean
     * MR2 (API level 18).
     * <p>
     * When two numeric fields are directly adjacent with no intervening
     * delimiter characters, they constitute a run of adjacent numeric fields.
     * Such runs are parsed specially. For example, the format "HHmmss"
     * parses the input text "123456" to 12:34:56, parses the input text
     * "12345" to 1:23:45, and fails to parse "1234". In other words, the
     * leftmost field of the run is flexible, while the others keep a fixed
     * width. If the parse fails anywhere in the run, then the leftmost field
     * is shortened by one character, and the entire run is parsed again.
     * This is repeated until either the parse succeeds or the leftmost field
     * is one character in length. If the parse still fails at that point,
     * the parse of the run fails.
     * @see set2DigitYearStart(Date)
     * for more about handling two-digit years.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Sample Code</strong>
     * <p>
     * If you're formatting for human use, you should use an instance returned from DateFormat as described above. This code:
     *
     * @sa Dateformat
     * <pre>
     *   DateFormat[] formats = new DateFormat[] {
     *   DateFormat.getDateInstance(),
     *   DateFormat.getDateTimeInstance(),
     *   DateFormat.getTimeInstance(),
     *   };
     *   for (DateFormat df : formats) {
     *    System.out.println(df.format(new Date(0)));
     *    }
     * </pre>
     *
     * Produces this output when run on an en_US device in the America/Los_Angeles time zone:
     * <pre>
     *   Dec 31, 1969
     *   Dec 31, 1969 4:00:00 PM
     *   4:00:00 PM
     * </pre>
     *
     * And will produce similarly appropriate localized human-readable output on any user's system.
     * If you're formatting for machine use, consider this code:
     * <pre>
     *   String[] formats = new String[] {
     *      "yyyy-MM-dd",
     *      "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm",
     *      "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mmZ",
     *      "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSZ",
     *      "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ",
     *       };
     *    for (String format : formats) {
     *       SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(format, Locale.US);
     *       System.out.format("%30s %s\n", format, sdf.format(new Date(0)));
     *       sdf.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone("UTC"));
     *       System.out.format("%30s %s\n", format, sdf.format(new Date(0)));
     *      }
     * </pre>
     * Which produces this output when run in the America/Los_Angeles time zone:
     * <pre>
     *                yyyy-MM-dd 1969-12-31
     *                yyyy-MM-dd 1970-01-01
     *          yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm 1969-12-31 16:00
     *          yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm 1970-01-01 00:00
     *         yyyy-MM-dd HH:mmZ 1969-12-31 16:00-0800
     *         yyyy-MM-dd HH:mmZ 1970-01-01 00:00+0000
     *   yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSZ 1969-12-31 16:00:00.000-0800
     *   yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSZ 1970-01-01 00:00:00.000+0000
     * yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ 1969-12-31T16:00:00.000-0800
     * yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000+0000
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * As this example shows, each SimpleDateFormat instance has a TimeZone.
     * This is because it's called upon to format instances of Date, which
     * represents an absolute time in UTC. That is, Date does not carry time
     * zone information. By default, SimpleDateFormat will use the system's
     * default time zone. This is appropriate for human-readable output
     * (for which, see the previous sample instead), but generally
     * inappropriate for machine-readable output, where ambiguity is a problem.
     *
     * @sa TimeZone
     * <p>
     * Note that in this example, the output that included a time but no time
     * zone cannot be parsed back into the original Date. For this reason it
     * is almost always necessary and desirable to include the timezone in
     * the output. It may also be desirable to set the formatter's time zone
     * to UTC (to ease comparison, or to make logs more readable, for example).
     * <p>
     * It is often best to avoid formatting completely when writing
     * dates/times in machine-readable form. Simply sending the "Unix time"
     * as a long or as the string corresponding to the long is cheaper and
     * unambiguous, and can be formatted any way the recipient deems
     * appropriate.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Synchronization</strong>
     * <p>
     * SimpleDateFormat is not thread-safe. Users should create a separate instance for each thread.
