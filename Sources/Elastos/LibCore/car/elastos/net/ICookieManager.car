     * This class provides a concrete implementation of CookieHandler. It separates
     * the storage of cookies from the policy which decides to accept or deny
     * cookies. The constructor can have two arguments: a CookieStore and a
     * CookiePolicy. The former is in charge of cookie storage and the latter makes
     * decision on acceptance/rejection.
     *
     * CookieHandler is in the center of cookie management. User can make use of
     * CookieHandler.setDefault to set a CookieManager as the default one used.
     *
     * CookieManager.put uses CookiePolicy.shouldAccept to decide whether to put
     * some cookies into a cookie store. Three built-in CookiePolicy is defined:
     * ACCEPT_ALL, ACCEPT_NONE and ACCEPT_ORIGINAL_SERVER. Users can also customize
     * the policy by implementing CookiePolicy. Any accepted HTTP cookie is stored
     * in CookieStore and users can also have their own implementation. Up to now,
     * Only add(URI, HttpCookie) and get(URI) are used by CookieManager. Other
     * methods in this class may probably be used in a more complicated
     * implementation.
     *
     * There are many ways to customize user's own HTTP cookie management:
     *
     * First, call CookieHandler.setDefault to set a new CookieHandler
     * implementation. Second, call CookieHandler.getDefault to use CookieManager.
     * The CookiePolicy and CookieStore used are customized. Third, use the
     * customized CookiePolicy and the CookieStore.
     *
     * This implementation conforms to <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2965.txt">RFC 2965</a> section 3.3.
     *
