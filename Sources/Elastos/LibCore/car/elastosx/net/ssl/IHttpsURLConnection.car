    /**
     * An {@link HttpURLConnection} for HTTPS (<a
     * href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818">RFC 2818</a>). A
     * connected {@code HttpsURLConnection} allows access to the
     * negotiated cipher suite, the server certificate chain, and the
     * client certificate chain if any.
     *
     * <h3>Providing an application specific X509TrustManager</h3>
     *
     * If an application wants to trust Certificate Authority (CA)
     * certificates that are not part of the system, it should specify its
     * own {@code X509TrustManager} via a {@code SSLSocketFactory} set on
     * the {@code HttpsURLConnection}. The {@code X509TrustManager} can be
     * created based on a {@code KeyStore} using a {@code
     * TrustManagerFactory} to supply trusted CA certificates. Note that
     * self-signed certificates are effectively their own CA and can be
     * trusted by including them in a {@code KeyStore}.
     *
     * <p>For example, to trust a set of certificates specified by a {@code KeyStore}:
     * <pre>   {@code
     *   KeyStore keyStore = ...;
     *   String algorithm = TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm();
     *   TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(algorithm);
     *   tmf.init(keyStore);
     *
     *   SSLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
     *   context.init(null, tmf.getTrustManagers(), null);
     *
     *   URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com/");
     *   HttpsURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
     *   urlConnection.setSSLSocketFactory(context.getSocketFactory());
     *   InputStream in = urlConnection.getInputStream();
     * }</pre>
     *
     * <p>It is possible to implement {@code X509TrustManager} directly
     * instead of using one created by a {@code
     * TrustManagerFactory}. While this is straightforward in the insecure
     * case of allowing all certificate chains to pass verification,
     * writing a proper implementation will usually want to take advantage
     * of {@link java.security.cert.CertPathValidator
     * CertPathValidator}. In general, it might be better to write a
     * custom {@code KeyStore} implementation to pass to the {@code
     * TrustManagerFactory} than to try and write a custom {@code
     * X509TrustManager}.
     *
     * <h3>Providing an application specific X509KeyManager</h3>
     *
     * A custom {@code X509KeyManager} can be used to supply a client
     * certificate and its associated private key to authenticate a
     * connection to the server. The {@code X509KeyManager} can be created
     * based on a {@code KeyStore} using a {@code KeyManagerFactory}.
     *
     * <p>For example, to supply client certificates from a {@code KeyStore}:
     * <pre>   {@code
     *   KeyStore keyStore = ...;
     *   String algorithm = KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm();
     *   KeyManagerFactory kmf = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(algorithm);
     *   kmf.init(keyStore);
     *
     *   SSLContext context = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
     *   context.init(kmf.getKeyManagers(), null, null);
     *
     *   URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com/");
     *   HttpsURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
     *   urlConnection.setSSLSocketFactory(context.getSocketFactory());
     *   InputStream in = urlConnection.getInputStream();
     * }</pre>
     *
     * <p>A {@code X509KeyManager} can also be implemented directly. This
     * can allow an application to return a certificate and private key
     * from a non-{@code KeyStore} source or to specify its own logic for
     * selecting a specific credential to use when many may be present in
     * a single {@code KeyStore}.
     *
     * <h3>TLS Intolerance Support</h3>
     *
     * This class attempts to create secure connections using common TLS
     * extensions and SSL deflate compression. Should that fail, the
     * connection will be retried with SSLv3 only.
     *
