 @brief Simple mutex class.The implementation is system-dependent.The mutex must be unlocked
 by the thread that locked it.  They are not recursive, i.e. the same thread can't lock it
 multiple times.

 A mutex (short for mutual exclusion) is a way of communicating among threads or processes
 that are executing asynchronously of one another. This communication is usually used to
 coordinate the activities of multiple threads or processes, typically by controlling access
 to a shared resource by locking and unlocking the resource. To solve this x,y coordinate
 update problem, the update thread sets a mutex indicating that the data structure is in use
 before performing the update. It would clear the mutex after both coordinates had been processed.
